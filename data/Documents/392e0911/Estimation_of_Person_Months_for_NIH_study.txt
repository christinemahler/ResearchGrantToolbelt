Given the high complexity in many areas for this particular NIH study and the medium complexity in the financial aspect, I will provide an estimation of the effort allocation and person months for the project duration. Let's make an assumption for the project duration of 5 years based on usual standards for such clinical trials.

### Assumed Effort Allocation Percentages:
- **DCC Principal Investigator**: 20% each year (Complex project management and oversight)
- **Clinical Data Manager(s)**: 75% (Extensive data management needs)
- **Statistician(s)**: 60% (Complex statistical analysis needs)
- **Clinical Project Manager**: 75% (Heavy workload managing clinical aspects)
- **Business Project Manager**: 25% in first two years, then phasing to 0% by year 3 (Initial setup requirement for business operations)
- **Software Engineering**: 25% initially, phasing down to 10% by end of year 5 (High IT demands)
- **IT Project Manager**: 30% initially, reducing to 10% by year 5 (Ongoing IT project management)
- **IT Operations**: 25% constant (Continuous IT support across multiple sites)
- **Ops Leader**: 20% (Consistent operational leadership)
- **Administrative Program Coordinator**: 15% (Administrative demands across sites)
- **Regulatory and Quality Assurance Manager**: 15% (High regulatory complexity)
- **Finance**: 10% (Medium financial complexity)
- **Biometrics Management**: 10% (Critical role in data review and assurance)
- **Clinical Project Manager Management**: 10% (Oversight of clinical manager duties)
- **IT Management**: 20% initially, reducing to 10% by end (IT oversight and direction)

### Calculation:
For each role, person months will be calculated based on the provided effort allocation percentages and an assumption of a 12-month year. For simplicity in this textual description, values will be rounded to the nearest half-month.

This table should aid the budget analysis team in formalizing the detailed budget form required for the NIH R&R Budget.
