6_Non-Personnel_Justification
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Non-Personnel Budget Justification for PAR-25-283: Innovative Mental Health Services Research

#### Travel ($45,000)
Travel expenses are allocated for conference attendance, collaboration meetings between sites, and necessary workshops. These activities are vital for disseminating findings, participating in relevant professional communities, and ensuring effective coordination across different project sites. The allotment here supports project leaders and key personnel to travel to two national conferences per year, facilitating the sharing of insights and best practices in mental health services research.

#### Materials and Supplies ($6,000)
This category covers office supplies and other materials necessary for the day-to-day operations of the research project. Included are items such as printing of documents, specialized software for data analysis specific to mental health studies, and other miscellaneous supplies. Adequate funding in this area ensures the project team has the necessary tools to perform their tasks efficiently and effectively.

#### Site Monitoring ($12,000)
Funds are allocated for periodic monitoring of project sites to ensure compliance with research protocols and federal regulations. This is particularly crucial in mental health research to maintain the integrity of the data and ensure the ethical handling of all study operations. These visits also allow for the on-site resolution of any issues that might arise during the project's duration.

#### Data and Safety Monitoring Board ($15,000)
Given the sensitive nature of mental health research, an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) is necessary to oversee and monitor safety throughout the study. This budget allocation covers the board members' honoraria, meeting expenses, and other administrative costs associated with the DSMB operations.

#### Single/Multiple IRB ($30,000)
To comply with regulatory standards and ensure ethical conduct in research involving human subjects, funding is allocated for both single and multiple institutional review board (IRB) reviews. These funds cater to application, administration, and periodic review fees, which are critical in maintaining ethical oversight and compliance throughout the study duration.

#### Publication Costs ($9,000)
This funding supports the costs associated with preparing, submitting, and publishing results in peer-reviewed journals. The availability of sufficient funds in this category is essential for disseminating research findings to the scientific community and the public, thereby contributing to broader knowledge and application of improved mental health services practices.

Each of these non-personnel budget categories has been strategically allocated to support the essential functions and requirements of the research project, ensuring adherence to quality standards and regulatory compliance while promoting effective collaboration and communication within the scientific community.
