### NIH Non-Personnel Budget Justifications for Funding Opportunity PAR-25-283: Innovative Mental Health Services Research Not Involving Clinical Trials

#### **Materials and Supplies**
- **Total Cost:** $2,000  
Younger researchers will need basic office materials and IT supplies. This allocation ensures the procurement of necessary items such as stationery, printing materials, and minor computer accessories. This efficient supply management supports the administrative and operational needs, promoting a smooth execution of the research tasks which inherently improves data collection and project management processes.

#### **Publication Costs**
- **Total Cost:** $3,000  
Costs have been allocated for the publication and dissemination of research findings through peer-reviewed journals and presentations at conferences. This is crucial for sharing information with the broader scientific community, which enhances the visibility and impact of the research. The allocation will cover article processing charges and possibly some expenses related to open access publications, ensuring that the results are accessible and can contribute to the field of mental health services.

#### **Consultant Services**
- **Total Cost:** $5,000  
Consultancy fees have been budgeted to engage a statistician who specializes in mental health research. This will ensure that the statistical analysis of data is conducted with high precision and integrity. By involving an expert consultant, the project will benefit from specialized skills that enhance the rigor and credibility of the research findings. This approach is particularly important given the medium complexity of the statistical analysis required for the project.

#### **ADP/Computer Services**
- **Total Cost:** $1,500  
Funds are allocated for basic computing needs including software subscriptions, minor hardware updates, and maintenance services. Given the project's low IT complexity, these resources will suffice to ensure efficient data management and secure communication channels. The provision for these services supports the seamless operation of software and hardware that are essential for the day-to-day running of the research activities.

Each of these categories has been carefully planned based on the specific needs and complexity of the study as outlined in the study complexity details for the funding opportunity, ensuring that all funds will directly contribute to the successful execution and outcomes of the research project.
