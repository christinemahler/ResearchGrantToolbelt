This table represents the total forecasted non-personnel costs for the duration of the project under the provided NIH guidelines and project complexity. The values listed above average per year expenditures, multiplied by 5 to reflect the total budget across the entire project lifespan. This assumes the average end of given ranges and typical expenditures for a project of medium complexity in mental health research services as described.
