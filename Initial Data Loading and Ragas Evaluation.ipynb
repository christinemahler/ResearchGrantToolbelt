pediatric psychologist who specializes in differences of sex development (DSD). Her overarching\\\\ncareer goal is to become an independently funded investigator focused on improving the psychosocial and\\\\nhealth outcomes of pediatric patients with DSD by creating tools to facilitate patient engagement in medical\\\\ndecision making through shared decision making (SDM). This award provides support for Dr. Suorsa-Johnson\\\\nto achieve the following Career Development Aims: Aim 1: Obtain expertise in SDM, including the\\\\ndevelopment of decision aids (DAs) for adolescents and young adults (AYAs); Aim 2: Gain sexual health\\\\neducation training, particularly as it relates to the creation of educational materials to enhance surgical SDM;\\\\nAim 3: Develop expertise in evaluating and implementing DAs; and Aim 4: Expand and strengthen research\\\\nleadership and management skills. To achieve these goals, Dr. Suorsa-Johnson has assembled a dedicated\\\\nteam of mentors and advisors with expertise in SDM (Angela Fagerlin, PhD), SDM in AYAs (Ellen Lipstein,\\\\nMD), sexual health education (Jordan Rullo, PhD), dissemination and implementation science (Jennie Hill,\\\\nPhD), qualitative design and clinical trials (Melissa Watt, PhD and Angela Fagerlin, PhD), multi-site trial design\\\\n(Gregory Stoddard, MBA, MPH), urogenital/gonadal surgeries in AYAs (Kathleen van Leeuwen, PhD), and\\\\nDSD education (David Sandberg, PhD and Erica Weidler, MEd, MS). A person with lived experience, Noi\\\\nLiang, MBA, MCPA, is consulting to ensure all aspects of the project align with the needs of those with DSD.\\\\nDSD are congenital conditions where chromosomal, gonadal, or anatomical sex development is atypical. AYAs\\\\nwith DSD make critical and potentially irreversible, life-altering urogenital/gonadal surgical decisions. However,\\\\nwe know little about how AYAs approach surgical decision making and no standardized SDM resources exist.\\\\nAs such, Dr. Suorsa-Johnson proposes to create and pilot a set of surgical DAs for AYAs with DSD. This will\\\\nbe achieved through three Specific Aims: Aim 1: Identify informational needs and values influencing surgical\\\\ndecision making for AYAs with DSD; Aim 2: Develop a set of evidence-based DAs for surgical decisions to\\\\nfacilitate SDM for AYAs and their caregivers; and Aim 3: Pilot test and refine DA content, delivery, and\\\\nfeasibility. This project will result in a set of surgical decision aids ready to be tested in a multi-site trial.\\\\nThis project is significant because it will change how we provide care and improve engagement in surgical\\\\ndecision making for this underserved, NIH-designated sexual and gender minority subpopulation. This\\\\ninnovative project is the first to explore the needs of AYAs with DSD making surgical decisions from a SDM\\\\nframework and create associated decision support tools.\", \"project_title\": \"Adolescents and Young Adults: Dilemmas, Education, and Choices Impacting Decisions (AYAs DECIDe) Study\", \"phr_text\": \"PROJECT NARRATIVE\\\\nAdolescents and young adults with differences of sex development make critical and potentially irreversible,\\\\nlife-altering surgical decisions about their bodies without standardized resources to support their engagement\\\\nin shared decision making. To fill this gap, the proposed research will examine the decisional needs of\\\\nadolescents and young adults with differences of sex development, as well as develop and pilot a set of\\\\nsurgical decision aids addressing identified needs. Standardized decision aid use will promote adolescent and\\\\nyoung adult engagement in shared decision making, leading to improved care, patient health, and\\\\npsychosocial outcomes.\", \"spending_categories_desc\": null, \"agency_code\": \"NIH\", \"budget_start\": \"2024-09-18T12:09:00Z\", \"budget_end\": \"2025-06-30T12:06:00Z\", \"funding_mechanism\": \"Other Research-Related\", \"direct_cost_amt\": 155051, \"indirect_cost_amt\": 12404, \"project_detail_url\": \"https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10985653\"}'),\n",

As the Data Coordination Resource Center,\\\\nwe will continue to work collaboratively with each ERN study team and the other HEAL ERN Resource Centers\\\\nto 1) develop, implement and monitor the ERN trials; 2) help respond to issues/protocol changes that emerge\\\\nduring trial implementation and initiate timely necessary changes to assure trial success; 3) provide collection\\\\nand analysis of data; and 4) assist with timely publication of study results. Our supplement application has two\\\\nSpecic Aims: Specifc Aim 1: Work with ERN investigators and other HEAL ERN Resource Centers to provide\\\\ncollaborative clinical trial expertise and assistance in study and protocol design, single IRB, study implementation\\\\nand management, accrual of subjects, interim study reporting, nal study analyses, and assistance with timely\\\\npublication and dissemination of study results. Specific Aim 2: Provide comprehensive data management for\\\\ncurrent and new ERN trials, including database and data collection systems, data management plans, data\\\\nrisk assessment and quality control, implementation of randomization, assistance with Data Safety Monitoring\\\\nBoard (DSMB) reports, and training for using the data collection systems. Additionally, we will facilitate sharing\\\\nof data from HEAL/ERN trials by incorporating HEAL Common Data Elements(CDEs) into protocols, continuing\\\\nto support NIH program staff in development of HEAL CDEs, continued participation in the HEAL Collective\\\\nBoard, and preparation of nal data sets suitable for deposit in NIH-designated repositories for incorporation into\\\\nthe HEAL Data Ecosystem. Our continued collaboration with ERN investigators and integration with the other\\\\nResource Centers will maximize the likelihood of successful and timely completion of the HEAL ERN clinical\\\\ntrials, leading to translation of research ndings to the effective management of acute and chronic pain, while\\\\nminimizing addictive opioid dosing regimens.\", \"project_title\": \"HEAL ERN: Data Coordinating Resource Center\", \"phr_text\": \"Narrative\\\\nThe NIH created the Helping to End Addiction Long-term (HEAL) initiative to speed scientic solutions to the\\\\nnational opioid public health crisis.

SUMMARY / ABSTRACT\\\\nHereditary deficiency of galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (GALT, E.C. 2.7.7.12) activity in humans\\\\ncan lead to a potentially lethal disease called Classic Galactosemia (OMIM 230400). Despite the life-saving\\\\nconsequences of newborn screening, early diagnosis, and a galactose-restricted diet, affected women\\\\ninvariably show ovarian damage and fertility impairment representing the greatest burden of their disease.\\\\nThere are currently no satisfactory treatments available to prevent this complication. Recently, insights into\\\\nthe underlying pathophysiology and innovative technological advancements have become available, and\\\\noptions for curative treatment have emerged. Using this momentum, we aim to develop a treatment to\\\\nprevent fertility impairments. We aim to 1) develop a non-viral nucleic acid therapy approach that targets the\\\\novary and 2) determine the optimal timing to rescue the ovarian function. Folliculogenesis is driven by the\\\\ncross-talk between oocytes and granulosa cells. Restoration of GALT activity in these cells could possibly\\\\nrescue the ovarian damage.\\\\nIn this pilot grant application, we will explore a new modality of gene therapy using nanoparticles\\\\nencapsulating episomal GALT cDNA within a non-viral expression vector. This will include determination of\\\\nthe optimal cationic polymer layer for delivery of episomal DNA plasmids expressing GFP or GALT to\\\\ngranulosa cell lines and the addition of ligands to encourage uptake and promote specificity.\\\\nIn addition, we will determine the optimal window of opportunity for this treatment. A prenatal origin has been\\\\nconsidered for decades whereas the data currently available, albeit scarce, favor a postnatal origin. There is\\\\nundoubtedly early damage, but whether treatments aimed to prevent ovarian damage needs to be started in\\\\nthe neonatal period, or treating in infancy or adolescence would suffice, is not clear. This will be studied using\\\\nthe zebrafish model for classic galactosemia that mimics the fertility impairments and is suitable for studies\\\\nthrough development. Zebrafish reproduction is regulated by the brain-pituitary-gonadal axis, comparable\\\\nto the human situation. For this purpose, RNA-seq, histology/immunohistochemistry of follicole\\\\ndevelopment and single cell RNA-seq of oocytes and granulosa cells at 4 developmental stages will\\\\nbe studied. These studies will uncover developmental stage and cell-specific alterations in the affected\\\\novaries. Distinctive patterns at the different stages are expected to reveal at which stage(s) damage\\\\ncan be prevented/halted using ovary targeted gene therapy.\", \"project_title\": \"Optimal Window of Opportunity for Granulosa Cell Gene Therapy in Galactosemia\", \"phr_text\": \"PROJECT NARRATIVE\\\\n Hypergonadotropic hypoestrogenic infertility due to ovarian damage is the greatest burden for women\\\\nsuffering from hereditary Classic Galactosemia, an inborn error of metabolism included in the newborn\\\\nscreening programs.

children with chronic diseases, who have\\\\ncomplex, multisystem chronic diseases affecting \\\\u22653 organ systems, severe functional limitations and technology\\\\ndependencies. CMC have high health care needs, and account for 40% of hospitalized children and 35% of all\\\\npediatric health care costs. Due to high medical fragility, CMC have frequent acute deteriorations superimposed\\\\non their chronic conditions, leading to recurrent emergency department (ED)/hospital admissions and affecting\\\\nquality of life (QOL). To reduce ED/hospital admissions for CMC, remote monitoring is suggested, with use of\\\\nmHealth apps to regularly assess their health status remotely and identify early signs of acute deterioration,\\\\nallowing for early interventions to prevent ED/hospital admissions. Yet no app to support remote monitoring of\\\\nCMC exists. Variable, multisystem conditions among CMC make it difficult to develop an app. Also, many CMC\\\\nare at high-risk for health care inequities, with minorities having higher unmet needs, but the impacts of health\\\\ncare inequities and social determinants of health (SDOH) on ED/hospital admissions in CMC are rarely studied.\\\\nFortunately, ED/hospital admissions for CMC are often preceded by a limited set of shared (crosscutting) acute\\\\nsymptoms. These crosscutting symptoms rarely occur suddenly. Studies suggest that they usually start as subtle\\\\nsigns, often unnoticed by parents until they escalate to prompt an ED/hospital visit. Thus, crosscutting symptoms\\\\noffer an opportunity for a novel and practical approach for developing a remote monitoring app for CMC,\\\\ndespite their multiple, variable underlying conditions. In a focus group, parents identified the crosscutting\\\\nsymptoms that most often preceded their children\\\\u2019s hospital admissions, and conveyed their needs, preferences\\\\nand key functionalities that led to MyChildCMC, the first app designed to monitor and identify early signs of\\\\ncrosscutting symptoms in CMC. In a pilot trial of 50 subjects, we confirmed feasibility of MyChildCMC use by\\\\nparents, ability to detect early signs 2-14 days prior to ED/hospital admissions, and use leading significantly to\\\\nfewer hospital days than controls. The current study will assess the efficacy and sustainability of MyChildCMC\\\\nin a fully-powered 6-month, 2-arm (MyChildCMC vs usual care) trial of CMC (age 1-18 years) and their parents.\\\\nParents assigned to MyChildCMC will use the app daily for 6 months, both arms will receive financial incentive\\\\nfor participation, then we will stop the incentive and follow subjects for 6 more months to assess sustainability at\\\\n12 months. We will also assess if MyChildCMC use will help reduce or eliminate inequities in ED/hospital\\\\nadmissions. Specific Aims are: 1) Determine MyChildCMC\\\\u2019s efficacy on 1.a. Child (ED/hospital use, hospital\\\\ndays and QOL) and 1.b. Parent (satisfaction, self-efficacy and stress) outcomes; 2) Compare ED/hospital use\\\\namong racial/ethnic and SDOH subgroups to assess potential effect of MyChildCMC on inequities; 3) Use mixed\\\\nmethods to identify child and parent factors associated with MyChildCMC\\\\u2019s use adherence and sustainability.\", \"project_title\": \"A Novel mHealth Intervention to Improve Outcomes of Children with Medical Complexity\", \"phr_text\": \"PROJECT NARRATIVE\\\\nFindings from this project will provide an effective, practical, and generalizable approach to supporting home\\\\nmonitoring of children with medical complexity (CMC).

Pharmacotherapy is a mainstay of treatment efforts, but optimal dosing is virtually unknown\\\\nbecause of the difficulty in measuring drug concentrations in the brain. The extent of brain exposure depends\\\\non drug properties and the permeability of the blood brain barrier (BBB). BBB permeability is affected by age\\\\nand disease and may change over time. In order to adequately characterize exposure, multiple concentration\\\\nmeasurements are needed over time. However, serial lumbar punctures in children are rarely advised or\\\\nindicated. Consequently, the exposure in the brain of most drugs to treat neurological diseases in children is\\\\nunknown. This lack of data to guide therapy risks toxicity and treatment failure in children. We have developed\\\\nan approach that combines sophisticated pharmacokinetic modeling with opportunistic, non-invasive, serial\\\\ndrug concentration measurements in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to determine optimal dosing. The work of\\\\nthis proposal will provide a platform to optimize dosing of drugs that treat neurological diseases across the\\\\npediatric age spectrum. This platform combines: 1) In vitro models of the BBB; 2) Opportunistic plasma and\\\\nCSF pharmacokinetic (PK) studies in children with external ventricular drains (EVDs). EVDs therapeutically\\\\nremove CSF from the patient and permit non-invasive, serial CSF sampling to measure drug concentrations; 3)\\\\nPhysiologically-based pharmacokinetic modeling (PBPK) to predict plasma and CSF drug exposure in children.\\\\nPBPK models can be modified to reflect differences in age and disease state. The principal investigator (PI)\\\\nhas a background in chemical and biomolecular engineering, in vitro systems, and modeling and simulation,\\\\nand is conducting an ongoing plasma and CSF PK study in children with EVDs. To elucidate mechanisms of\\\\ndrug passage into the CSF and to optimize CNS drug dosing in children, the PI will pursue training through the\\\\nK99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award mechanism at the University of Utah. To guide this training, an\\\\nexperienced mentorship team will provide expertise in clinical trials, in vitro models, membrane transporters,\\\\nand sophisticated pharmacometric methods. In the mentored phase, in vitro BBB models will measure BBB\\\\npermeability of five drugs commonly used in children in the context of age and disease. These measurements\\\\nand information from the literature will inform pediatric CNS-PBPK models of these drugs in children. Then,\\\\nCNS-PBPK models will be optimized using serial plasma and CSF PK measurements from children with EVDs\\\\nacross disease states and the pediatric age spectrum, and optimal dosing regimens will be determined. In the\\\\nindependent phase, the PI will conduct a prospective PK and safety trial to validate optimal, patient-specific\\\\ndosing regimens for two drugs targeting the CNS in children.

new investigators, and provide support and advocacy for families during the conduct of excellent,\\\\nethical clinical research. During the current funding cycle, PHN Utah implemented a leadership transition plan\\\\nwith the next generation of locally and PHN trained researchers joining senior investigators with >20 years of\\\\nPHN experience. They led 6 studies and made substantial contributions to PHN scientific discoveries and\\\\nadministrative activities. Recruitment and retention of participants was among the highest of all centers due to\\\\nthe committed, diverse PHN Utah team with 24-hour coverage to approach every eligible patient. The long-\\\\nstanding collaborations among Utah investigators, planned leadership transition, and continued strong\\\\ninstitutional support will allow a seamless transition into the next cycle. Going forward, the increasing diversity\\\\nof the Intermountain West will provide unique access to participants unrepresented in research: rural and\\\\nfrontier populations, Native American/Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander communities. PHN\\\\nUtah is ideally positioned to contribute to a more equitable, diverse, and inclusive PHN focused on addressing\\\\nhealth care inequities and the 2 specific pillars to support transformational impact: 1) addressing existing\\\\ninequity in clinical outcomes and 2) big data/data science using existing infrastructure. PHN Utah will expand\\\\ntheir successful collaboration with Utah\\\\u2019s Pediatric Cardiac Genomics Consortium to develop a robust\\\\nmechanism for extracting and sharing pertinent, machine-readable clinical data from Electronic Health Records\\\\nacross all PHN sites and use a robust Artificial Intelligence platform to explore the complex interplay between\\\\nphenotype; genotype; maternal, clinical, social determinants of health (SDOH), and racial/ethnic factors; and\\\\nclinical outcomes. Our aims are to 1) enhance PHN Utah\\\\u2019s exemplary performance and leadership by building\\\\non prior experience with a new vision and additional expertise and infrastructure informed by lessons learned\\\\nfrom PHN leadership roles, collaborations, and studies, 2) address EDI issues in all aspects of research and\\\\ntraining to amplify successes in mentoring the next generation of researchers in an increasingly diverse and\\\\ninclusive research environment, and 3) create the PHN Data Resource consisting of clinical, genomic, and\\\\nSDOH data to empower equitable, personalized outcomes prediction. PHN Utah is committed to the overall\\\\nmission of the PHN, has a proven track record of contributions to the success of the PHN, effective leadership\\\\nlocally and within the PHN, strong institutional support, proven mentorship of the next generation of physician\\\\nscientists, and will add significant resources to address equity and diversity, and provide existing infrastructure\\\\nto support a big data approach to personalized medicine.\", \"project_title\": \"Pediatric Heart Network (PHN) - Utah Center\", \"phr_text\": \"PROJECT NARRATIVE\\\\nAs a Core Clinical Research Center for >20 years, Pediatric Heart Network (PHN) Utah has supported the\\\\nmission to improve outcomes for individuals with congenital heart disease and pediatric acquired heart\\\\ndisease, and made particularly exceptional contributions to scientific discoveries, administrative activities, and\\\\ntraining the next generation of researchers.

\"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT\\\\n Phosphoglucomutase 1 (PGM1) catalyzes the interconversion of glucose-1 phosphate (Glc-1P) and glucose-6\\\\nphosphate (Glc-6P) and therefore, it plays a fundamental role in glycolysis, glycogenesis, and glycogenolysis.\\\\nConsequently, inherited deficiency of PGM1 in humans has previously been identified as Glycogen Storage Disorder\\\\n(GSD) Type 14, but has lately been revealed as a Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation (CDG) with mixed type I and\\\\ntype II glycosylation defects. The liver, the skeletomuscular, endocrine and coagulation systems all get involved over\\\\ntime, but the most life-threatening complication is the early onset of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Recently, we\\\\ndiscovered that oral D-galactose supplementation improved serum transferrin hypoglycosylation, liver function, endocrine\\\\nabnormalities, and reduces frequency of hypoglycemic episodes, but does not alleviate the fatal cardiomyopathy and most\\\\nmuscle symptoms. To study the pathobiology of cardiac disease in PGM1-CDG patients, we constructed cardiomyocyte-\\\\nspecific conditional Pgm2 (mouse ortholog of human PGM1) knockout mice (Pgm2 cKO) mice. Using\\\\nechocardiography, we corroborated a DCM phenotype with significantly reduced ejection fraction and left ventricular\\\\ndilation similar to those seen in PGM1-CDG patients. Ultrastructural analysis revealed Z-disk disarray,\\\\nswollen/fragmented mitochondria and macroscopic thickening in the heart of a PGM1-CDG patient. Preliminary\\\\ntranscriptomic analysis of hearts from Pgm2 cKO mice demonstrates a gene signature of DCM. Assessing the\\\\nglycoproteomic profile of left ventricular tissue of Pgm2 cKO mice, our group showed significant glycosylation defects in\\\\nsarcolemmal proteins including Laminin-211 (Merosin), sarcoglycans and biglycan. Collectively, not only does our\\\\nmouse model recapitulate the cardiac phenotypes of PGM1-CDG patients, but our characterization to-date also supports\\\\nthe overarching hypothesis that altered glycosylation alone cannot fully explain the pathobiology of cardiac symptoms in\\\\nPGM1-CDG patients as other biochemical and metabolic disturbances may also contribute. To test this hypothesis, we\\\\nwill (1) examine for altered energy metabolism, and (2) clarify the role played by aberrant glycosylation of sarcolemmal\\\\nproteins in the DCM development in the Pgm2 cKO mice. Lastly, we will test the therapeutic potential of PGM1 gene\\\\nreplacement in the Pgm2 cKO mice by assessing whether PGM1 augmentation will restore the energetic deficit and\\\\nreverse Lamnin-211 glycosylation abnormalities resulting in improved cardiac function and survival in Pgm2\\\\ncKO mice.\", \"project_title\": \"Pathobiological mechanisms of cardiac disease in PGM1-CDG\", \"phr_text\": \"PROJECT NARRATIVE\\\\nPhosphoglucomutase I Deficiency, an inborn error of metabolism, was formerly classified as Glycogen Storage Disorder\\\\nType 14, although recent research demonstrated that it is also a Congenital Disorder of Glycosylation (CDG) with mixed\\\\nglycosylation defects. Many aspects of the pathophysiology of the complex disease phenotypes, which include the\\\\ntherapy-resistant lethal dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) remains unclear, despite oral galactose supplementation improves\\\\nsome other clinical symptoms. The long-term goals of this project are to employ cardiac-specific conditional Pgm2-\\\\nknockout mouse model to (a) define the pathogenic mechanisms of the cardiac phenotypes; and (b) develop effective, safe\\\\nand evidence-based therapies to address the unmet medical needs of the patients.\", \"spending_categories_desc\": null, \"agency_code\": \"NIH\", \"budget_start\": \"2024-12-01T12:12:00Z\", \"budget_end\": \"2025-11-30T12:11:00Z\", \"funding_mechanism\": \"Non-SBIR/STTR\", \"direct_cost_amt\": 451535, \"indirect_cost_amt\": 135147, \"project_detail_url\": \"https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10991821\"}'),\n",

\"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT\\\\n Phosphoglucomutase 1 (PGM1) catalyzes the interconversion of glucose-1 phosphate (Glc-1P) and glucose-6\\\\nphosphate (Glc-6P) and therefore, it plays a fundamental role in glycolysis, glycogenesis, and glycogenolysis.\\\\nConsequently, inherited deficiency of PGM1 in humans has previously been identified as Glycogen Storage Disorder\\\\n(GSD) Type 14, but has lately been revealed as a Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation (CDG) with mixed type I and\\\\ntype II glycosylation defects. The liver, the skeletomuscular, endocrine and coagulation systems all get involved over\\\\ntime, but the most life-threatening complication is the early onset of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Recently, we\\\\ndiscovered that oral D-galactose supplementation improved serum transferrin hypoglycosylation, liver function, endocrine\\\\nabnormalities, and reduces frequency of hypoglycemic episodes, but does not alleviate the fatal cardiomyopathy and most\\\\nmuscle symptoms. To study the pathobiology of cardiac disease in PGM1-CDG patients, we constructed cardiomyocyte-\\\\nspecific conditional Pgm2 (mouse ortholog of human PGM1) knockout mice (Pgm2 cKO) mice. Using\\\\nechocardiography, we corroborated a DCM phenotype with significantly reduced ejection fraction and left ventricular\\\\ndilation similar to those seen in PGM1-CDG patients. Ultrastructural analysis revealed Z-disk disarray,\\\\nswollen/fragmented mitochondria and macroscopic thickening in the heart of a PGM1-CDG patient. Preliminary\\\\ntranscriptomic analysis of hearts from Pgm2 cKO mice demonstrates a gene signature of DCM. Assessing the\\\\nglycoproteomic profile of left ventricular tissue of Pgm2 cKO mice, our group showed significant glycosylation defects in\\\\nsarcolemmal proteins including Laminin-211 (Merosin), sarcoglycans and biglycan. Collectively, not only does our\\\\nmouse model recapitulate the cardiac phenotypes of PGM1-CDG patients, but our characterization to-date also supports\\\\nthe overarching hypothesis that altered glycosylation alone cannot fully explain the pathobiology of cardiac symptoms in\\\\nPGM1-CDG patients as other biochemical and metabolic disturbances may also contribute. To test this hypothesis, we\\\\nwill (1) examine for altered energy metabolism, and (2) clarify the role played by aberrant glycosylation of sarcolemmal\\\\nproteins in the DCM development in the Pgm2 cKO mice. Lastly, we will test the therapeutic potential of PGM1 gene\\\\nreplacement in the Pgm2 cKO mice by assessing whether PGM1 augmentation will restore the energetic deficit and\\\\nreverse Lamnin-211 glycosylation abnormalities resulting in improved cardiac function and survival in Pgm2\\\\ncKO mice.\", \"project_title\": \"Pathobiological mechanisms of cardiac disease in PGM1-CDG\", \"phr_text\": \"PROJECT NARRATIVE\\\\nPhosphoglucomutase I Deficiency, an inborn error of metabolism, was formerly classified as Glycogen Storage Disorder\\\\nType 14, although recent research demonstrated that it is also a Congenital Disorder of Glycosylation (CDG) with mixed\\\\nglycosylation defects. Many aspects of the pathophysiology of the complex disease phenotypes, which include the\\\\ntherapy-resistant lethal dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) remains unclear, despite oral galactose supplementation improves\\\\nsome other clinical symptoms. The long-term goals of this project are to employ cardiac-specific conditional Pgm2-\\\\nknockout mouse model to (a) define the pathogenic mechanisms of the cardiac phenotypes; and (b) develop effective, safe\\\\nand evidence-based therapies to address the unmet medical needs of the patients.\", \"spending_categories_desc\": null, \"agency_code\": \"NIH\", \"budget_start\": \"2023-12-01T12:12:00Z\", \"budget_end\": \"2024-11-30T12:11:00Z\", \"funding_mechanism\": \"Non-SBIR/STTR\", \"direct_cost_amt\": 497655, \"indirect_cost_amt\": 161476, \"project_detail_url\": \"https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10824796\"}'),\n",

(AF) is the most common clinical cardiac arrhythmia, with a strong component of heritability.\\\\nPatients with AF are at significant risk for debilitating complications, such as stroke, heart failure and sudden\\\\ndeath. Emerging evidence suggests that both common and rare genetic variants in cardiac transcription factors\\\\ncontribute to AF susceptibility. This link between transcription factors and AF offers exciting opportunities to\\\\ninvestigate previously unrecognized pathways to identify novel \\\\u201cupstream\\\\u201d therapeutic targets. We recently\\\\nidentified the cardiac transcription factor NFATC1 as a novel AF susceptibility gene in a family with autosomal\\\\ndominant young-onset AF. The overall goal of this proposal is to explore the molecular and electrophysiological\\\\nrole of NFATC1 in cardiac excitability. Our central hypothesis is that NFATC1 directly regulates genes involved\\\\nin maintaining calcium homeostasis in the atrium. We proposed three specific aims to test this hypothesis: (1)\\\\nidentify NFATC1 transcriptional effectors linked to calcium homeostasis in atria; (2) establish the\\\\nelectrophysiological consequences of NFATC1 disruption in atrial cells; and (3) define NFATC1 modulation of\\\\nadrenergic signaling in the heart. The output of this project will be a comprehensive understanding of the\\\\ntranscriptional networks mediated by NFATC1 that impact calcium homeostasis and promote arrhythmogenesis,\\\\nlaying the foundation for potential future therapies.\\\\nThe research activities proposed in this career mentored award will provide experiential learning in support of\\\\nmy career development objectives.

critical time to establish survivorship care for young adult (YA)\\\\ncancer survivors ages 26 to 39. Receipt of evidence-based survivorship care, including surveillance for cancer\\\\nrecurrence based on national guidelines, remain low among YA survivors. At the same time, YAs ages 26 to\\\\n39 have the highest rate of both uninsurance and underinsurance among US adults. Our team\\\\u2019s prior work\\\\ndemonstrated that YA cancer survivors report low understanding of their health insurance and the services it\\\\ncovers, which affects their ability to navigate care. Together, these issues can lead to significant access to care\\\\nbarriers and severe medical cost consequences for this population. This proposal addresses the urgent need\\\\nto improve YA cancer survivors\\\\u2019 health insurance literacy and decrease financial toxicity, thus improving their\\\\nability to receive recommended survivorship care. Guided by Andersen and Aday\\\\u2019s Behavioral Model of Health\\\\nServices Use, we developed and pilot-tested a 4-session virtual patient navigation intervention for YA cancer\\\\nsurvivors that was adapted from a pilot program for childhood cancer survivors. Initial results support feasibility,\\\\nacceptability, and preliminary efficacy of both of these pilot trials with YA survivors ages 26 to 39.

Further, UUHC and IH have an integrated data\\\\ninfrastructure which allows us to capture electronic health records and claims data to investigate whether\\\\nCHAT-S improves surveillance care for recurrence at 18-month follow-up (secondary outcome).

the clinical implementation of\\\\ngenomic medicine remains elusive. This Specialized Innovation Program (SIP) will identify and overcome\\\\nbarriers that impede the translational science of rapid genomic medicine discoveries at the point of care by\\\\nassembling the infrastructure, technology, and strategies to design and develop a rapid genomic diagnostic\\\\nplatform, using the newborn intensive care unit (NICU) as a laboratory. Emerging clinical guidelines support\\\\nthe value and utility of rapid whole-genome sequencing in the NICU, yet multiple barriers impede the\\\\nwidespread use of this technology at the point of care. Specifically, (1) less than half of rare Mendelian\\\\ndiseases are solvable using current sequencing and analytical technologies; (2) industry electronic health\\\\nrecord (EHR)-based genomic medicine applications are essentially nonexistent, with a lack of EHR-interfaced\\\\nplatforms that allow for visualization and team-based interpretation of genomic sequencing; (3) translational\\\\nscience strategies to implement genomic medicine into clinical care are currently lacking. To overcome these\\\\nbarriers, the SIP will design and develop an innovative, collaborative, patient-focused, and EHR-interfaced\\\\ntranslational platform that efficiently integrates rapid genomic medicine at the point of care, using the NICU as\\\\na laboratory. Aim 1 will design novel tools that will improve the discovery of all forms of genetic variation,\\\\nincluding difficult-to-detect complex structural variants. These novel tools will be shared as open-source\\\\nsoftware, with accompanying tools for dissemination and implementation, to empower translational genomic\\\\nscience across the CTSA network. Aim 2 will deploy a portable EHR-interfaced platform for rapid genomic\\\\ndiagnostics that is appropriate, acceptable, and feasible across EHR systems and will catalyze clinical and\\\\ntranslational science locally, regionally, and nationally. Aim 3 will use a participatory planning strategy and\\\\nstate of the science dissemination and implementation science methods to develop, tailor, and operationalize\\\\nstrategies to support NICU adoption, implementation, and sustainability of a translational platform for rapid\\\\ngenomic diagnostics. These strategies will be compiled into a generalizable blueprint to foster genomic\\\\ninnovations across the CTSA network and empower broader adoption and sustained implementation of\\\\ngenomic medicine.\", \"project_title\": \"CTSA RC2 Program at University of Utah: A Translational Platform for Rapid Genomic Medicine\", \"phr_text\": \"NARRATIVE\\\\nThe goal of this Specialized Innovation Program is to identify and overcome barriers that impede the\\\\ntranslational science of rapid genomic medicine discoveries at the point of care by assembling the\\\\ninfrastructure, technology, and strategies to design and develop a rapid genomic diagnostic platform, using the\\\\nnewborn intensive care unit as our laboratory.

the clinical implementation of\\\\ngenomic medicine remains elusive. This Specialized Innovation Program (SIP) will identify and overcome\\\\nbarriers that impede the translational science of rapid genomic medicine discoveries at the point of care by\\\\nassembling the infrastructure, technology, and strategies to design and develop a rapid genomic diagnostic\\\\nplatform, using the newborn intensive care unit (NICU) as a laboratory. Emerging clinical guidelines support\\\\nthe value and utility of rapid whole-genome sequencing in the NICU, yet multiple barriers impede the\\\\nwidespread use of this technology at the point of care. Specifically, (1) less than half of rare Mendelian\\\\ndiseases are solvable using current sequencing and analytical technologies; (2) industry electronic health\\\\nrecord (EHR)-based genomic medicine applications are essentially nonexistent, with a lack of EHR-interfaced\\\\nplatforms that allow for visualization and team-based interpretation of genomic sequencing; (3) translational\\\\nscience strategies to implement genomic medicine into clinical care are currently lacking. To overcome these\\\\nbarriers, the SIP will design and develop an innovative, collaborative, patient-focused, and EHR-interfaced\\\\ntranslational platform that efficiently integrates rapid genomic medicine at the point of care, using the NICU as\\\\na laboratory. Aim 1 will design novel tools that will improve the discovery of all forms of genetic variation,\\\\nincluding difficult-to-detect complex structural variants. These novel tools will be shared as open-source\\\\nsoftware, with accompanying tools for dissemination and implementation, to empower translational genomic\\\\nscience across the CTSA network. Aim 2 will deploy a portable EHR-interfaced platform for rapid genomic\\\\ndiagnostics that is appropriate, acceptable, and feasible across EHR systems and will catalyze clinical and\\\\ntranslational science locally, regionally, and nationally. Aim 3 will use a participatory planning strategy and\\\\nstate of the science dissemination and implementation science methods to develop, tailor, and operationalize\\\\nstrategies to support NICU adoption, implementation, and sustainability of a translational platform for rapid\\\\ngenomic diagnostics. These strategies will be compiled into a generalizable blueprint to foster genomic\\\\ninnovations across the CTSA network and empower broader adoption and sustained implementation of\\\\ngenomic medicine.\", \"project_title\": \"CTSA RC2 Program at University of Utah: A Translational Platform for Rapid Genomic Medicine\", \"phr_text\": \"NARRATIVE\\\\nThe goal of this Specialized Innovation Program is to identify and overcome barriers that impede the\\\\ntranslational science of rapid genomic medicine discoveries at the point of care by assembling the\\\\ninfrastructure, technology, and strategies to design and develop a rapid genomic diagnostic platform, using the\\\\nnewborn intensive care unit as our laboratory.

The two trials\\\\nwill be managed by different mechanisms. The first trial (herein referred to as the primary trial) will be managed\\\\nsimilarly to the five ongoing HEAL ERN trials. The three HEAL ERN resource centers will function as an integrated\\\\ninfrastructure to provide clinical coordinating center (CCC) support (Duke/Vanderbilt), data coordinating center\\\\n(DCC) support (Utah), and biostatistics support (Hopkins/Tufts). The second trial (herein referred to as the\\\\nsecondary trial) will be managed by the University of Utah for both CCC and DCC support. For both trials Utah\\\\nwill provide single institutional review board (sIRB) services. In addition to the Sickle Cell trials, this supplement\\\\nalso covers Utah support for the HEAL Common Data Elements (CDE) Program for one year. Efforts to date\\\\non the CDE Program focused on the pain arm of HEAL, led by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders\\\\nand Stroke (NINDS). The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) leads the Opioid arm, which is beginning CDE\\\\nefforts. This CDE supplement request covers work to be performed by the HEAL CDE team at the University\\\\nof Utah, and supports three main activities: (1) CDE document preparation (NINDS), (2) HEAL CDE program\\\\nadministrative operations (NINDS), and (3) Survey of instruments used by OUD studies (NIDA). The University\\\\nof Utah HEAL ERN Resource Center is requesting an administrative supplement to enable support of the NIH\\\\nHEAL initiative as described above. The supplement will support the following specific aims:\\\\nSpecific Aim 1. Provide data coordinating center support for the primary sickle cell trial, working with the other\\\\n ERN Resource Centers in the same manner as the current five ERN trials, as detailed in the parent grant.\\\\nSpecific Aim 2. Provide comprehensive clinical and coordinating center support for the secondary sickle cell\\\\ntrial.\\\\nSpecific Aim 3.

As part of the HEAL initiative, the HEAL Effectiveness Research Network\\\\n(ERN) was established to conduct comparative effectiveness trials for prevention and management of pain, while\\\\nreducing risk of addiction. Five ERN trials have been implemented with data coordination support from the\\\\nUniversity of Utah Trial Innovation Center. This proposal is written in response to RFA-TR-22-012 to provide\\\\ncontinued support for these \\\\ufb01ve trials, as well as two additional trials that may be funded in response to RFA-AT-22-\\\\n005 (\\\\u201cHEAL Initiative: Sickle Cell Disease Pain Management Trials Utilizing the Pain Management Effectiveness\\\\nResearch Network Cooperative Agreement\\\\u201d). The University of Utah is responding to be the Data Coordination\\\\nResource Center (DCRC).\\\\n We will continue to work collaboratively with each ERN study team and the other HEAL ERN Resource\\\\nCenters to 1) develop, implementand monitor the ERN trials; 2) help respond to issues/protocol changes that\\\\nemerge during trial implementation and initiate timely necessary changes to assure trial success; 3) provide\\\\ncollection and analysis of data; and 4) assist with timely publication of study results.\\\\n Our application has three Speci\\\\ufb01c Aims: 1. Work with ERN investigators and other HEAL ERN Resource\\\\nCenters to provide collaborative clinical trial expertise and assistance in study and protocol design, single IRB,\\\\nstudy implementation and management, accrual of subjects, interim study reporting, \\\\ufb01nal study analyses, and\\\\nassistance with timely publication and dissemination of study results. 2. Provide comprehensive data manage-\\\\nment for current and new ERN trials, including database and data collection systems, data management plans,\\\\ndata risk assessment and quality control, implementation of randomization, assistance with Data Safety Monitor-\\\\ning Board (DSMB) reports, and training for using the data collection systems. 3. Facilitate sharing of data from\\\\nHEAL/ERN trials by incorporating HEAL Common Data Elements(CDEs) into protocols, continuing to support\\\\nNIH program staff in development of HEAL CDEs, continued participation in the HEAL Collective Board, and\\\\npreparation of \\\\ufb01nal data sets suitable for deposit in NIH-designated repositories for incorporation into the HEAL\\\\nData Ecosystem.\\\\n Our collaboration with ERN investigators and integration with the other Resource Centers will maximize the\\\\nlikelihood of successful and timely completion of the HEAL ERN clinical trials, leading to translation of research\\\\n\\\\ufb01ndings to the effective management of acute and chronic pain, while minimizing addictive opioid dosing regi-\\\\nmens.\", \"project_title\": \"HEAL ERN: Data Coordinating Resource Center\", \"phr_text\": \"Project Narrative\\\\n The NIH created the Helping to End Addiction Long-term (HEAL) initiative to speed scienti\\\\ufb01c solutions to the\\\\nnational opioid public health crisis.

Their unique structural composition and porosity facilitates the loading of large therapeutic\\\\npayloads for site-specific drug delivery. Since past two decades our team characterized silica nanoparticles\\\\nand obtained data on cellular uptake, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity in rodents. However, very little is known\\\\nabout pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of silica nanoparticles in humans. A better understanding of the\\\\npharmacokinetics of silica nanoparticles in humans is essential for their clinical translation. Physiologically\\\\nbased pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling is well established strategy to translate mechanistic knowledge from\\\\nanimals to humans. We propose to develop PBPK models of silica nanoparticles in mice and rats and\\\\nextrapolate them to humans to establish a relationship between organ accumulation, and human dose. PBPK\\\\nmodels integrate compound specific data with physiology of the organism to predict the pharmacokinetics of\\\\ndrugs. PBPK models are mechanistic and can account for complex in vivo transport mechanisms of\\\\nnanoparticles such as opsonization, mononuclear phagocyte system uptake, lymphatic transport, and cellular\\\\ninternalization. Once the predictive performance of nanoparticle PBPK models in preclinical models is verified,\\\\nthe mechanisms governing nanoparticle PK can be easily extrapolated to humans by replacing relevant\\\\nphysiological information. The final human nanoparticle PBPK model extrapolated from animals can be used\\\\nfor first-in-human predictions. There are no PBPK models available for silica nanoparticles that can incorporate\\\\nall relevant properties required for extrapolation to humans.

Increasing evidence suggests that the levels of the cofactor NAD+ and the\\\\nactivity of NAD+-dependent proteins such as sirtuins have close links to the process of aging and development\\\\nof chronic diseases. While many studies exploring the health benefit of nutritional supplementation with sirtuin\\\\nactivators and NAD+-precursors have had encouraging preclinical results, there are currently no drug\\\\ncandidates that directly act on NAD+-metabolism. The objective of the proposed research project is to develop\\\\na potent activator of nicotinamide phosphorybosyltransferase (NAMPT), the enzyme that catalyzes the rate\\\\nlimiting step in NAD+ synthesis, and to evaluate its ability to reverse age-related physiological dysfunction in a\\\\npreclinical mouse model. Although previous studies have established that NAMPT activation can have age-\\\\ndelaying and disease-preventing effects, no currently available therapeutics are directed at modulating NAMPT\\\\nactivity per se. The proposed research addresses the key limitation towards accessing such drug candidates,\\\\nwhich is the lack of a potent, selective, and mechanistically validated lead molecules for NAMPT activation with\\\\na favorable absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) profile. To access such a compound, in\\\\nthe R21 phase of this application, we propose to develop and screen a NAMPT-focused DNA-encoded\\\\nchemical library and to use computational drug discovery methods to advance screening hits into potent lead\\\\ncandidate compounds. The efficacy of NAMPT activators will be tested with in vitro assays and in three\\\\ndifferent cell lines. Once candidate compounds are identified, the R33 phase will consist, first of\\\\ncomprehensive pharmacokinetic studies in lead candidate compounds to determine the appropriate dose and\\\\nroute of administration for in vivo studies. The lead compound will then be utilized to assess the impact of\\\\ntreatment on physiological measures of healthspan in middle-aged and old mice. The project, if successful, will\\\\ndeliver preclinical lead compounds for the development of first-in-class therapeutics that directly target the\\\\naging-related pathways of a wide range of chronic diseases. In the long term, such drugs may help decrease\\\\nthe morbidity and mortality of geriatric patients.\", \"project_title\": \"Improving healthspan through discovery of potent NAMPT activators from a DNA-encoded library\", \"phr_text\": \"Narrative\\\\nThe objective of the proposed research project is to develop a potent activator of nicotinamide\\\\nphosphorybosyltransferase (NAMPT), the enzyme that catalyzes the rate limiting step in NAD+ synthesis, and\\\\nto evaluate its ability to prevent and possibly reverse the progression of aging-related chronic diseases in a\\\\npreclinical model.

opioids are potent activators of the mu-opioid receptor (\\\\u00b5OR; OPRM1 gene),\\\\nexpressed in many cancer types, and can impact cancer cell survival and the efficacy of lifesaving\\\\nchemotherapy. For patients with cancer, opioid use often coincides with chemotherapy, making opioid-\\\\nchemotherapy interactions inevitable. For some cancers, including lung, prostate, gastric, breast, and\\\\nesophageal cancers, opioid use and increased \\\\u00b5OR expression are linked to increased tumor growth,\\\\nmetastases, and shorter patient survival. In contrast, in vitro and animal model studies for glioblastoma, certain\\\\nbreast cancers, and T- and B-cell acute leukemias, opioids stimulate cancer cell death and, in some cases,\\\\nenhance cytotoxic chemotherapeutic response. The seemingly paradoxical effects likely have a concentration-\\\\ndependent dimension as physiologic opioid exposures have tended to induce pro-proliferative effects while\\\\nsupraphysiologic opioid exposures are typically associated with cancer cell death. While \\\\u00b5OR activation can\\\\nenhance the killing effect of genotoxic chemotherapy in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, our preliminary data\\\\ndemonstrate opioids antagonize the apoptotic response of Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) chronic\\\\nmyeloid leukemia cells (K562) to molecularly-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) chemotherapy. As\\\\nleukemias are treated with both genotoxic and molecularly targeted chemotherapy assessing the potential for\\\\nclinically used opioids to antagonize or synergize in leukemic cell killing is an urgent medical need. We\\\\npropose to test the central hypothesis, that chemotherapeutic response will change in the presence of\\\\nclinically relevant concentrations of opioids, in three Aims. Specific Aim 1: Quantify standard-of-care\\\\nopioid exposures and determinants of exposure in patients with leukemia. Hypothesis 1: Interpatient variability\\\\nin opioid exposure will exceed 50% due to inherent metabolic differences, disease status, and treatment-\\\\nrelated pharmacokinetic alterations. Specific Aim 2: In leukemic cell lines, changes in response to\\\\nchemotherapy based on leukemic subtype and \\\\u00b5OR function will be determined. Hypothesis 2: Clinically-\\\\nexperienced concentrations of opioids will change chemotherapeutic response in different leukemic subtypes\\\\ncorresponding with \\\\u00b5OR function by >25%. Specific Aim 3: In patients with leukemia, the frequency of opioid-\\\\nchemotherapy DDIs based on clinical and molecular factors will be determined. Hypothesis 3: Clinical and\\\\nmolecular features associated with opioid-chemotherapy DDI conferring chemotherapy resistance are present\\\\nin >20% of patients prescribed opioids. Understanding the impact of \\\\u00b5OR activity on chemotherapeutic\\\\nresponse across similar but biologically distinct leukemia cell types will provide new insights into mechanisms\\\\nunderlying drug resistance, relapse, or non-response and drive precision medicine in opioid prescribing. This\\\\nproposal will provide key preliminary data to support an NIH R01 aimed at predicting altered chemotherapeutic\\\\nresponse due to supportive care medication exposure among patients undergoing treatment for leukemia.\", \"project_title\": \"Opioid-induced changes to chemotherapeutic activity in blood cancer\", \"phr_text\": \"PROJECT NARRATIVE\\\\nIt is desirable to avoid detrimental drug interactions to ensure each patient achieves the best possible\\\\nresponse to their chemotherapy.

potent activators of the mu-opioid receptor (\\\\u00b5OR; OPRM1 gene),\\\\nexpressed in many cancer types, and can impact cancer cell survival and the efficacy of lifesaving\\\\nchemotherapy. For patients with cancer, opioid use often coincides with chemotherapy, making opioid-\\\\nchemotherapy interactions inevitable. For some cancers, including lung, prostate, gastric, breast, and\\\\nesophageal cancers, opioid use and increased \\\\u00b5OR expression are linked to increased tumor growth,\\\\nmetastases, and shorter patient survival. In contrast, in vitro and animal model studies for glioblastoma, certain\\\\nbreast cancers, and T- and B-cell acute leukemias, opioids stimulate cancer cell death and, in some cases,\\\\nenhance cytotoxic chemotherapeutic response. The seemingly paradoxical effects likely have a concentration-\\\\ndependent dimension as physiologic opioid exposures have tended to induce pro-proliferative effects while\\\\nsupraphysiologic opioid exposures are typically associated with cancer cell death. While \\\\u00b5OR activation can\\\\nenhance the killing effect of genotoxic chemotherapy in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, our preliminary data\\\\ndemonstrate opioids antagonize the apoptotic response of Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) chronic\\\\nmyeloid leukemia cells (K562) to molecularly-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) chemotherapy. As\\\\nleukemias are treated with both genotoxic and molecularly targeted chemotherapy assessing the potential for\\\\nclinically used opioids to antagonize or synergize in leukemic cell killing is an urgent medical need. We\\\\npropose to test the central hypothesis, that chemotherapeutic response will change in the presence of\\\\nclinically relevant concentrations of opioids, in three Aims. Specific Aim 1: Quantify standard-of-care\\\\nopioid exposures and determinants of exposure in patients with leukemia. Hypothesis 1: Interpatient variability\\\\nin opioid exposure will exceed 50% due to inherent metabolic differences, disease status, and treatment-\\\\nrelated pharmacokinetic alterations. Specific Aim 2: In leukemic cell lines, changes in response to\\\\nchemotherapy based on leukemic subtype and \\\\u00b5OR function will be determined. Hypothesis 2: Clinically-\\\\nexperienced concentrations of opioids will change chemotherapeutic response in different leukemic subtypes\\\\ncorresponding with \\\\u00b5OR function by >25%. Specific Aim 3: In patients with leukemia, the frequency of opioid-\\\\nchemotherapy DDIs based on clinical and molecular factors will be determined. Hypothesis 3: Clinical and\\\\nmolecular features associated with opioid-chemotherapy DDI conferring chemotherapy resistance are present\\\\nin >20% of patients prescribed opioids. Understanding the impact of \\\\u00b5OR activity on chemotherapeutic\\\\nresponse across similar but biologically distinct leukemia cell types will provide new insights into mechanisms\\\\nunderlying drug resistance, relapse, or non-response and drive precision medicine in opioid prescribing.

The aims of the project are as follows. In aim 1, Dr. Lin will apply\\\\nnew skills in health communication to identify effective risk communication methods to communicate\\\\nuncertainty in decision making for children with NMS. In aim 2, Dr. Lin will design a decision support tool for\\\\nuse during orthopaedic consultation for children with NMS, including discoveries from aim 1. In aim 3, Dr. Lin\\\\nwill conduct a pilot feasibility and acceptability study of the decision support tool. This study will inform the\\\\ndevelopment of a large, multicenter trial of the decision support tool for children with NMS.\\\\nThrough the training and research activities embedded in this proposal, Dr. Lin will address gaps in our\\\\nunderstanding of how to support treatment decision making for children with NMS. This study will serve as a\\\\ncritical model for developing decision supports for clinical decisions in the growing population of children with\\\\nmedical complexity. Completion of the proposed activities will prepare Dr. Lin to independently lead a larger\\\\nresearch program evaluating and developing decision support to improve outcomes for populations of children\\\\nand adults with multiple comorbid conditions through better SDM.\", \"project_title\": \"Developing an Innovative Decision Support Tool for Pediatric Neuromuscular Scoliosis\", \"phr_text\": \"PROJECT NARRATIVE\\\\nFor the growing population of children with medical complexity, many medical decisions have no clear best\\\\ntreatment option; such decisions should be guided by individual patient preferences and values and clear\\\\ncommunication of decision-related uncertainty through the use of shared decision making.

children, calculating ejection (EF) and shortening fraction (SF) using echocardiography (echo) is the\\\\nstandard of care for evaluating left ventricular (LV) function. Despite their ubiquitous use, EF and SF are poorly\\\\nreproducible, calculated from multiple measurements each with their own error that is propagated, and\\\\nmeasure endocardial volume change without directly measuring contractility. Deformation strain is\\\\nfundamentally different from EF and SF. Instead of measuring volumes, echo software technology provides\\\\nspeckle-tracking of myocardial movement to measure regional and global myocardial deformation to obtain LV\\\\nstrain. Since this process is automated, it removes a large degree of observer-dependence. In addition, since\\\\nstrain is a single measurement rather than a derived parameter calculated from multiple measurements, the\\\\nerror for machine-derived strain should be substantially reduced. LV strain has been widely studied in adults\\\\nwhere normal reference ranges are validated and it is used to predict clinical outcomes and refine therapies. In\\\\ncontrast, LV strain reference values based on a large, diverse population of children are not available and\\\\nstrain remains largely a research tool in the pediatric population. To address this, we will establish Z-scores\\\\nusing the PHN Echo Database. This database includes all images needed for LV strain measurements from\\\\n3526 echoes obtained in a well-characterized population of healthy children ranging in age from birth to 18\\\\nyears. Z-scores account for the effects of maturation and growth by considering body size, age, gender, and/or\\\\nrace when evaluating whether measurements are normal or, if abnormal, how many standard deviations they\\\\ndeviate from the mean. Establishing Z-scores is the most powerful and flexible approach to normalizing\\\\ncardiovascular parameters for the effects of age and body size and has become the standard approach in\\\\npediatric cardiology. We will determine if independent parameters such as age, height, weight, body surface\\\\narea, or heart rate can predict changes in LV strain with maturation and/or growth. To guide clinical use, we will\\\\ndetermine the feasibility and reproducibility of LV strain measurements for images collected as part of routine\\\\nclinical care rather than as part of a rigorous research protocol. We will evaluate the effect of sampling\\\\nfrequency on Z-scores for clinically indicated studies by comparing those with \\\\u226530 vs. <30 frames/heartbeat in\\\\neach age category. This project is highly significant and will impact nearly every pediatric subspecialty. LV\\\\nstrain Z-scores will enable longitudinal studies to determine if LV strain is more predictive of outcomes than EF\\\\nor SF in children. If so, strain would move into clinical use and lead to a paradigm shift in the evaluation and\\\\nmanagement of diseases where the child is at risk for LV dysfunction and subsequent heart failure. The PHN\\\\ndatabase of normal echo images obtained as routine clinical care from a large, well-characterized population of\\\\nhealthy children provides a unique, cost-effective opportunity to establish normal LV strain Z-scores and rapidly\\\\ndeploy them for use in the real world setting of a busy pediatric echo lab.\", \"project_title\": \"Analysis of the Pediatric Heart Network Echocardiogram Database to Establish Left Ventricular Strain Z-scores\", \"phr_text\": \"PROJECT NARRATIVE\\\\nBecause normal reference ranges are known, evaluation of cardiac strain has been valuable as an earlier\\\\ndetector of abnormal function and a better predictor of outcomes in adults at risk for heart failure.

ABSTRACT\\\\nAsthma is the most common chronic illness of childhood and a leading cause of hospitalization and healthcare\\\\ncosts for children. Most children hospitalized for asthma first receive breathing treatments and steroid\\\\nmedicines in an emergency department (ED) according to national guidelines. An additional medicine,\\\\nintravenous magnesium sulfate (IVMg), may help severely sick children avoid hospitalization. National asthma\\\\nguidelines recommend IVMg for severely sick children, but note a lack of consistent evidence to support this\\\\nrecommendation. Only about one in four children hospitalized for asthma received IVMg in the ED. Estimates\\\\nof the potential effects of broader use of IVMg on hospitalization are limited by the small size of prior trials, but\\\\nincreased use could potentially avoid 18,000 hospitalizations each year, producing direct cost savings of $65\\\\nmillion yearly in addition to saving significant indirect costs of missed school and parental work.\\\\nA few major questions remain about IVMg. First, it has not been tested early in ED treatment, when the impact\\\\non hospitalization would be greatest. Second, the clinical impact of hypotension, a driver of low utilization, is\\\\nnot characterized in prior trials or clinical databases. Third, no trials have compared different IVMg doses or\\\\nmeasured serum magnesium levels to optimize dosing, so the most effective dose is unknown.\\\\nAll prior trials of IVMg in children with asthma have been small. A large randomized, placebo-controlled clinical\\\\ntrial of IVMg that could answer whether IVMg can reduce hospitalization might be challenging for a few\\\\nreasons. First, enrolling patients fast enough to give IVMg early in ED treatment is challenging. Second,\\\\nunderstanding blood pressure changes after IVMg is essential to plan safety monitoring for a larger trial. Third,\\\\nlittle pharmacologic information has been gathered to guide the doses of IVMg to be tested.

Encephalopathy (DICE trial)\\\\nHypoxia-ischemia encephalopathy (HIE, commonly called \\\\u201cbirth asphyxia\\\\u201d) is a condition where the brain\\\\ndoesn\\\\u2019t get enough oxygen. HIE affects 2 out of every 1,000 babies. Despite early intervention using brain\\\\ncooling, outcomes of death or major disability, such as cerebral palsy and mental retardation, still occurs in\\\\nnearly 30% of these babies. No other therapies have been proven to further reduce brain injury for these high\\\\nrisk infants. Furthermore, additional brain injury may be caused by concomitant use of drugs such as morphine\\\\nto treat pain and sedation in this population. Morphine use in animal models can increase neuronal apoptosis\\\\nand negatively affect neurodevelopment. Developing adjunctive therapies that improve outcomes in infants\\\\nwith HIE is an urgent, unmet public health need.\\\\nDexmedetomidine is a potent \\\\u03b12-adrenergic receptor agonist that may be a better alternative to morphine for\\\\nnewborns with neonatal HIE treated with cooling. Dexmedetomidine provides sedation, analgesia, and\\\\nprevents shivering but does not suppress breathing. Importantly, dexmedetomidine has been shown to protect\\\\nthe brain in animal models of brain injury. Recent clinical studies also suggest improved brain outcomes after\\\\ndexmedetomidine administration in adult patients with brain injury. Even though there are limited data on\\\\ndexmedetomidine safety and usefulness as well as pharmacokinetics (PK; drug levels in blood) in infants with\\\\nHIE it has been increasingly administered in many centers.\\\\nOur central hypothesis is that dexmedetomidine administered for sedation to full-term infants with HIE\\\\nundergoing cooling will be safe (AIM 1) and will be associated with improved short and long-term outcomes\\\\n(AIM 3). To test this hypothesis, we have designed a Phase II multicenter, randomized, safety and PK trial.\\\\nFifty infants (n=25 in each arm) with HIE and requiring sedation will be randomized to receive either\\\\ndexmedetomidine (1 \\\\u03bcg/kg for loading dose followed by 0.1 to 0.5 \\\\u03bcg/kg/h continuous infusion) or morphine\\\\n(0.02-0.03 mg/kg/dose intermittent dosing q 4 hours IV or as continuous infusion dose of 0.005- 0.01\\\\nmg/kg/hr). Two opportunistic PK samples (at time of routine laboratories) and a PRN PK sample any time there\\\\nis an adverse event will be obtained for measurement of Dexmedetomidine plasma concentrations (AIM 2).\\\\nPromising preliminary data show that dexmedetomidine may improve outcomes but optimal dosing, safety, and\\\\nefficacy still need to be established. We propose to confirm dexmedetomidine optimal dosing by collecting\\\\nopportunistic blood samples for PK data and determine safety of dexmedetomidine in this population in a\\\\nphase II safety trial. These data will inform a larger phase III trial to assess the efficacy of this therapy in\\\\nreducing the risk of long-term disabilities in infants with HIE who survive beyond the newborn period.\", \"project_title\": \"Dexmedetomidine Use in Infants undergoing Cooling due to Neonatal Encephalopathy (DICE trial)\", \"phr_text\": \"PROJECT NARRATIVE\\\\nIn spite of early intervention using brain cooling, outcomes of death or significant handicap still occur in nearly\\\\n30% of newborn babies with birth asphyxia.

The majority of childhood\\\\nhospitalizations are for common conditions, but currently, there are major gaps in the evidence of how best to\\\\ncare for these conditions (e.g., \\\\u201cwhat is the most effective systemic corticosteroid regimen for children\\\\nhospitalized with asthma?\\\\u201d). Additionally, over 70% of US children are hospitalized in community hospitals, but\\\\nthe vast majority of federal funding for pediatric research goes to free-standing children\\\\u2019s hospitals. Evidence\\\\ngaps and the scarcity of research in community hospital settings contribute to suboptimal health outcomes for\\\\nhospitalized children, such as complications from unnecessary treatments, prolonged hospital stays, hospital\\\\nreadmissions, and poor chronic disease control. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) can guide evidence-\\\\nbased care and improve child health outcomes. RCTs minimize potential biases in research findings by\\\\nrandomly allocating study participants to treatment groups. Thus, they represent the highest-quality studies for\\\\nguiding the care of hospitalized children.\\\\nOur overall objective is to develop a national RCT agenda in pediatric hospital medicine (PHM) and critical\\\\nresources for achieving that agenda. To achieve this objective, we propose to hold a research development\\\\nconference. We have recruited a diverse group of PHM stakeholders for this conference, including\\\\nmultidisciplinary PHM clinicians from children\\\\u2019s and community hospitals (e.g., physicians, nurses,\\\\npharmacists), clinical and health services researchers, patients and families, health equity experts, and\\\\npolicymakers. In Aim 1, we will engage conference attendees in using an established method, concept\\\\nmapping, to identify and prioritize RCT questions for the 20 most prevalent conditions in PHM. In Aim 2, we\\\\nwill identify barriers and facilitators to conducting PHM RCTs in community hospitals. In Aim 3, we will\\\\ndisseminate conference findings via three national partner organizations.\\\\nOur proposed conference will fill critical gaps by setting an actionable national PHM research agenda,\\\\nidentifying strategies for meaningfully engaging both children\\\\u2019s and community hospitals in achieving this\\\\nagenda, and assembling critical partners for carrying out this agenda. These findings will have an important\\\\npositive impact by guiding future research efforts to improve hospital care and health outcomes for children,\\\\nan AHRQ priority population.

impose major health threats on\\\\nneonates. Although CMV and HSV are lifelong infections with periods of latency and reactivation, most maternal\\\\ninfections remain undiagnosed due to nonspecific or absent clinical symptoms. In the United States, a child is\\\\npermanently disabled by cCMV infection every hour, even though 9 of 10 infants are asymptomatic after birth and\\\\nremain undiagnosed. Invasive nHSV, on the other hand, is a rare neonatal infection that presents with a broad\\\\nrange of clinical symptoms, including those that may be life-threatening. Viral culture and DNA detection by\\\\npolymerase chain reaction (PCR) have become the \\\\u201cGold Standard\\\\u201d for the diagnosis of cCMV and nHSV infection,\\\\ndespite poor sensitivity of PCR assays in neonates and time consuming culture techniques (up to 5-7 days).\\\\n Universal genotyping of pathogen genomic sequences using High Resolution Melt (U-HRM) provides a simple,\\\\nlow cost, rapid, and modern alternative to viral cultures and PCR techniques. By measuring the fluorescence of\\\\nan intercalating dye as PCR-amplified pathogen DNA or RNA fragments are heated and disassociate, sequence\\\\ndefined melt curves, or \\\\u201cfingerprints\\\\u201d, are generated with single-nucleotide resolution in a closed-tube reaction.\\\\nThese unique microbial \\\\u201cfingerprints\\\\u201d are then automatically identified and quantified using machine learning\\\\ntechnology, with an accuracy of 99-100% on minimal blood volume (1 mL), in a platform called NeoChip. Presently,\\\\nwe have established unique signature melt curves for 40 bacterial species and antimicrobial resistance genes that\\\\ncommonly infect neonates. Additionally, NeoChip has been expanded to distinguish individually amplified melt\\\\ncurve signatures for multiple pathogen identification and quantification, as required for polymicrobial infection.\\\\n In this proposal, we will build out NeoChip\\\\u2019s comprehensive database by incorporating clinical strains of CMV\\\\nand HSV with actionable antiviral resistance genes. Because NeoChip identifies variances in nucleic acid\\\\nsequences, individual differentiation and quantification of CMV and HSV strains are possible. We will also translate\\\\nthe NeoChip for specific and rapid diagnosis of cCMV and nHSV infection in a large prospective clinical study of\\\\npregnant women and their offspring(s), as well as directly compare the platform to standard quantitative nucleic\\\\nacid test (QNAT) assays, IgG/IgM antibody testing, and clinical outcome measures for statistical concordance\\\\n(predictive value). Finally, we will validate and translate NeoChip for cCMV detection and clinical correlation using\\\\ndried blood spot (DBS) samples for incorporation into standard universal newborn screening programs. NeoChip\\\\u2019s\\\\ngoal is to provide an accurate and valid test for the timely diagnosis of pathogen etiology (viral, bacterial, and\\\\nfungal) in a single test with efficacy on broad tissue matrices and capacity to inform microbial resistance, thereby\\\\nfacilitating early administration of targeted antimicrobials and therapeutics. This proposal directly addresses the\\\\nfunding call by applying a multidisciplinary approach to address the biomedical challenges of rapidly and accurately\\\\ndiagnosing cCMV and nHSV to facilitate disease prognostication and early therapeutic or intervention programs.\", \"project_title\": \"NeoChip for specific and rapid identification of congenital CMV and neonatal HSV infections on minimal sample volume\", \"phr_text\": \"Project Narrative\\\\nNeoChip combines real-time PCR, digital High Resolution Melting (dHRM) of DNA and RNA, and machine\\\\nlearning to create unique \\\\u201cfingerprints\\\\\" for microbes and antimicrobial resistance, allowing for faster and more\\\\nprecise detection of pathogen(s) causing neonatal infection.

Congenital cytomegalovirus (cCMV) and neonatal herpes simplex virus (nHSV) impose major health threats on\\\\nneonates. Although CMV and HSV are lifelong infections with periods of latency and reactivation, most maternal\\\\ninfections remain undiagnosed due to nonspecific or absent clinical symptoms. In the United States, a child is\\\\npermanently disabled by cCMV infection every hour, even though 9 of 10 infants are asymptomatic after birth and\\\\nremain undiagnosed. Invasive nHSV, on the other hand, is a rare neonatal infection that presents with a broad\\\\nrange of clinical symptoms, including those that may be life-threatening. Viral culture and DNA detection by\\\\npolymerase chain reaction (PCR) have become the \\\\u201cGold Standard\\\\u201d for the diagnosis of cCMV and nHSV infection,\\\\ndespite poor sensitivity of PCR assays in neonates and time consuming culture techniques (up to 5-7 days).\\\\n Universal genotyping of pathogen genomic sequences using High Resolution Melt (U-HRM) provides a simple,\\\\nlow cost, rapid, and modern alternative to viral cultures and PCR techniques.

activity in humans can\\\\nlead to a potentially lethal disease called Classic Galactosemia (OMIM 230400). Despite the life-saving consequences of\\\\nnewborn screening, early diagnosis, and a galactose-restricted diet, many patients with Classic Galactosemia suffer later in\\\\nlife from complications including growth, neuropsychological, and speech delays as well as primary ovarian insufficiency\\\\n(POI). There are currently no satisfactory treatments available to prevent/alleviate any of these complications. The precise\\\\npathogenic mechanisms of these complications remain unclear, although aberrant galactosylation of glycoproteins/lipids\\\\nand inositol phospholipid signaling caused by the chronic exposure to toxic intermediates of the blocked galactose metabolic\\\\npathway in susceptible tissues have been proposed. But regardless of the proposed mechanisms and any of the associated\\\\ncontroversies, no one will debate that the root cause for the disease is the deficiency of GALT enzyme activity in the affected\\\\ntissues. Therefore, we collaborated with colleagues at Moderna Inc. to explore if we could augment functional GALT\\\\nactivity in an animal model of Classic Galactosemia with an innovative GALT mRNA therapy. Specifically, we hypothesize\\\\nthat targeted augmentation of hepatic GALT activity by GALT mRNA therapy is sufficient to restore whole-body galactose\\\\nmetabolism and ameliorate the disease-relevant phenotypes in Classic Galactosemia. Preliminary results showed that\\\\nintravenous injection of human GALT mRNA in GalT-/- mice resulted in hepatic expression of active, long-lasting GALT\\\\nenzyme, which rapidly and effectively reduced gal-1P in liver and some other peripheral tissues and significantly lowered\\\\nplasma galactose. Yet, it is too early to tell if biomarker correction can lead to actual phenotypic improvements. Therefore,\\\\nwe aim to demonstrate in this application that sole augmentation of hepatic GALT activity in a mouse model of\\\\nGalactosemia is sufficient to ameliorate the disease-relevant phenotypes (Aim 1) and restore normal whole-body galactose\\\\nmetabolism (oxidation) (Aim 2). If we are successful, we will be able to advance this experimental mRNA therapy to\\\\nclinical trials (high reward), and this could bring an innovative therapy to address the unmet medical needs of the patients -\\\\na high-impact outcome. Moreover, the critical information about the optimal timing of treatment and predictive values of\\\\nthe biomarkers to be revealed in the proposed work will render significant insights to the disease process and guide the\\\\ndevelopment of other modalities, including gene therapy. Last but not least, if we can show that restoration of galactose\\\\nmetabolism in the liver can result in significant improvement of whole-body galactose oxidation, this could lead to diet\\\\nrelaxation (high impact) and such therapeutic strategy could be applied to other metabolic diseases at which targeted therapy\\\\nis preferred (wide impact).\", \"project_title\": \"Advancing a novel experimental mRNA-based therapy for Classic Galactosemia\", \"phr_text\": \"PROJECT NARRATIVE\\\\nClassic Galactosemia is a rare inborn error of metabolism that is included in all newborn screening programs in the United\\\\nStates.

activity in humans can\\\\nlead to a potentially lethal disease called Classic Galactosemia (OMIM 230400). Despite the life-saving consequences of\\\\nnewborn screening, early diagnosis, and a galactose-restricted diet, many patients with Classic Galactosemia suffer later in\\\\nlife from complications including growth, neuropsychological, and speech delays as well as primary ovarian insufficiency\\\\n(POI). There are currently no satisfactory treatments available to prevent/alleviate any of these complications. The precise\\\\npathogenic mechanisms of these complications remain unclear, although aberrant galactosylation of glycoproteins/lipids\\\\nand inositol phospholipid signaling caused by the chronic exposure to toxic intermediates of the blocked galactose metabolic\\\\npathway in susceptible tissues have been proposed. But regardless of the proposed mechanisms and any of the associated\\\\ncontroversies, no one will debate that the root cause for the disease is the deficiency of GALT enzyme activity in the affected\\\\ntissues. Therefore, we collaborated with colleagues at Moderna Inc. to explore if we could augment functional GALT\\\\nactivity in an animal model of Classic Galactosemia with an innovative GALT mRNA therapy. Specifically, we hypothesize\\\\nthat targeted augmentation of hepatic GALT activity by GALT mRNA therapy is sufficient to restore whole-body galactose\\\\nmetabolism and ameliorate the disease-relevant phenotypes in Classic Galactosemia. Preliminary results showed that\\\\nintravenous injection of human GALT mRNA in GalT-/- mice resulted in hepatic expression of active, long-lasting GALT\\\\nenzyme, which rapidly and effectively reduced gal-1P in liver and some other peripheral tissues and significantly lowered\\\\nplasma galactose. Yet, it is too early to tell if biomarker correction can lead to actual phenotypic improvements. Therefore,\\\\nwe aim to demonstrate in this application that sole augmentation of hepatic GALT activity in a mouse model of\\\\nGalactosemia is sufficient to ameliorate the disease-relevant phenotypes (Aim 1) and restore normal whole-body galactose\\\\nmetabolism (oxidation) (Aim 2). If we are successful, we will be able to advance this experimental mRNA therapy to\\\\nclinical trials (high reward), and this could bring an innovative therapy to address the unmet medical needs of the patients -\\\\na high-impact outcome. Moreover, the critical information about the optimal timing of treatment and predictive values of\\\\nthe biomarkers to be revealed in the proposed work will render significant insights to the disease process and guide the\\\\ndevelopment of other modalities, including gene therapy. Last but not least, if we can show that restoration of galactose\\\\nmetabolism in the liver can result in significant improvement of whole-body galactose oxidation, this could lead to diet\\\\nrelaxation (high impact) and such therapeutic strategy could be applied to other metabolic diseases at which targeted therapy\\\\nis preferred (wide impact).\", \"project_title\": \"Advancing a novel experimental mRNA-based therapy for Classic Galactosemia\", \"phr_text\": \"PROJECT NARRATIVE\\\\nClassic Galactosemia is a rare inborn error of metabolism that is included in all newborn screening programs in the United\\\\nStates. A galactose-restricted diet, which is currently the mainstay of treatment, can prevent neonatal lethality of the\\\\naffected patients, but has little effect on long-term complications such as primary ovarian insufficiency, tremors, and\\\\nataxia. The long-term goal of this project is to advance an innovative, experimental liver-specific GALT mRNA therapy\\\\ninto a new, safe, and more effective therapy to tackle the unmet medical needs of galactosemic patients.\", \"spending_categories_desc\": \"Biotechnology; Digestive Diseases; Genetics; Liver Disease; Nutrition; Orphan Drug; Pediatric; Prevention; Rare Diseases\", \"agency_code\": \"NIH\", \"budget_start\": \"2021-08-17T12:08:00Z\", \"budget_end\": \"2022-07-31T12:07:00Z\", \"funding_mechanism\": \"Non-SBIR/STTR\", \"direct_cost_amt\": 150000, \"indirect_cost_amt\": 78750, \"project_detail_url\": \"https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10303541\"}'),\n",

An alternative approach to diagnosing immunoparalysis is the measurement of the\\\\nexpression of the antigen-presenting molecule HLA-DR on the surface of circulating monocytes (mHLA-DR)\\\\nusing flow cytometry.

Though mHLA-DR expression will not be used to drive cohort\\\\nassignment, its addition will allow for the evaluation of mHLA-DR expression as a potential diagnostic tool that\\\\ncould drive treatment in the future. This is important because there are currently no FDA-approved laboratory\\\\ntests for the diagnosis of immunoparalysis, and if the PRECISE study is positive, there is currently no way to\\\\nrapidly generalize its results. The addition of mHLA-DR expression to the dataset provides a unique and time-\\\\nlimited opportunity to understand if thresholds of mHLA-DR expression exist that equate to the TNF\\\\u03b1 response\\\\ncutoff used in the PRECISE study; and to understand if mHLA-DR expression can serve as a predictor of a\\\\nfavorable response to GM-CSF.

The expanded network has geographic, racial/ethnic\\\\nand socioeconomic diversity, and will be a platform to develop additional investigators, especially young clinician\\\\nscientists. The network will conduct a highly innovative large-scale multi-center study of personalized, targeted\\\\nimmune modulation in children with sepsis-induced multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). The study\\\\nincludes two concurrent, immunophenotype-driven placebo controlled RCTs that will address the central hypoth-\\\\nesis that individualized, pathophysiology-speci\\\\ufb01c immunomodulation will improve outcomes from sepsis-induced\\\\nMODS in children. This study builds on R01-funded CPCCRN studies that have demonstrated the existence of\\\\nspeci\\\\ufb01c immune phenotypes among children with sepsis-induced MODS (R01GM108618 PI: Carcillo) and suc-\\\\ncessful reversal of immunosuppression by administration of the immunostimulant granulocyte macrophage-colony\\\\nstimulating factor (GM-CSF) (R01GM094203 PI: Hall).

Agents that\\\\ndecrease oxidative stress and inflammation may decrease neurologic disability after TBI, particularly in\\\\nchildren. Docosahexaenoic Acid, or DHA, is a candidate therapy for childhood TBI. In our established rat pup\\\\nmodel of pediatric TBI, DHA improved functional outcome and decreased brain oxidative stress, white matter\\\\ninjury and inflammation. DHA is available as a nutritional supplement for infants and children. However, DHA\\\\ncannot be tested in clinical TBI trials until critical knowledge gaps are breached. Effects of DHA on oxidative\\\\nstress, white matter integrity and inflammation in the human brain after TBI are unknown, as are data on\\\\noptimal DHA dosing in humans after TBI. DHA safety and efficacy in the immature brain cannot be predicted\\\\nbased on adult studies. Relative to the adult brain, the immature brain has a more vigorous inflammatory\\\\nresponse and a lesser antioxidant capacity. DHA is a direct antioxidant, but at high doses its numerous double\\\\nbonds could instead magnify free radical damage after pediatric TBI. We propose to address these unknowns\\\\nusing fluid-percussion injury (FPI) in the piglet, a well-established model of pediatric TBI. Immature pig and\\\\nhuman brains share striking nutritional, anatomic and developmental similarities. Piglet FPI, unlike rodent TBI,\\\\nallows clinically relevant monitoring using serial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), urine and blood sampling. We have\\\\ncharacterized piglet FPI of moderate severity and established a methodology of DHA administration and\\\\nbiofluid sampling. We hypothesize that acute DHA administration will decrease oxidative stress, white matter\\\\ndamage and inflammation, associated with biomarkers of efficacy and toxicity, in piglets after FPI. We will use\\\\n4-week old piglets exposed to FPI or SHAM surgery, treated with one of two DHA doses (40 or 200mg/kg/day)\\\\nor vehicle (VEH). We will measure biomarkers of oxidative stress, white matter damage and inflammation in\\\\nCSF, urine and blood samples taken at 1, 3 and 7 days after FPI. We will compare biomarker results between\\\\nDHA dosing groups, and to day 7 brain assays of neuronal death, white matter damage, inflammation and\\\\noxidative injury to proteins, lipids and DNA in the brain. This proposal is significant because it will lay the\\\\ngroundwork for efficacy and safety monitoring during future clinical trials of candidate neuroprotectants, such\\\\nas DHA, in children after TBI by providing data on DHA dosing and biomarkers of efficacy and toxicity in a\\\\ntranslational model. It is innovative because little is known about DHA after acute brain injury during\\\\ndevelopment or about the utility of biomarkers in pediatric TBI. It will impact the field by providing clinically\\\\nrelevant measures of efficacy and safety needed to design a Phase II trial and, ultimately, an interventional trial\\\\nof DHA with the potential to decrease the burden of acquired neurologic injury after pediatric TBI.\", \"project_title\": \"Effects of Docosahexaenoic Acid on Oxidative Stress White Matter Injury and Brain Inflammation in a Pre-Clinical Model of Pediatric TBI\", \"phr_text\": \"PROJECT NARRATIVE\\\\nTraumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of acquired disability in children, yet no effective therapies\\\\nexist.

Long-term HRQL following pediatric septic shock may be\\\\naffected by many baseline and clinical factors that have not yet been adequately investigated. The long-term\\\\ngoal of this research is to improve outcomes from pediatric community-acquired septic shock. The overall\\\\nobjective is to identify modifiable factors related to the clinical course of children with septic shock as well as pre-\\\\nexisting child or environmental factors that may impact long-term morbidity and mortality. The central hypothesis\\\\nis that identifiable, modifiable factors during pediatric community-acquired septic shock may affect the risk of\\\\nlong-term morbidity and mortality among children encountering septic shock, as well as the risk of family\\\\ndysfunction and psychological distress among their caregivers. The expected outcomes of the research are new\\\\nknowledge about factors contributing to adverse child and family outcomes following pediatric septic shock. This\\\\nnew knowledge will have a positive impact because it will provide an evidence-base for the development and\\\\ntesting of new interventions targeted at modifiable factors. The specific aims of this project are Aim 1) Identify\\\\nbaseline characteristics that are associated with impaired long-term functional status and health-related quality\\\\nof life among children following community-acquired septic shock. Aim 2) Identify aspects of the clinical course\\\\nthat are associated with impaired long-term functional status and health-related quality of life among children\\\\nfollowing community-acquired septic shock. Aim 3) Identify factors associated with long-term family functioning\\\\nand psychological distress of the primary caregiver following their child\\\\u2019s hospitalization for community-acquired\\\\nseptic shock. The approach to address these aims is to collaborate with junior investigators and their local\\\\nmentors from several academic institutions to answer important questions about pediatric sepsis using a publicly\\\\navailable dataset from the NIH-funded Life After Pediatric Sepsis Evaluation (LAPSE) study. Junior investigators\\\\nwill be provided with complete biostatistical support and additional mentorship from experts in pediatric sepsis\\\\nand the LAPSE study. This contribution is significant because it will provide an evidence basis for designing\\\\ndefinitive clinical trials and developing clinical protocols that address modifiable factors to optimizing care and\\\\nimproving long-term child and family outcomes following septic shock.

Long-term HRQL following pediatric septic shock may be\\\\naffected by many baseline and clinical factors that have not yet been adequately investigated. The long-term\\\\ngoal of this research is to improve outcomes from pediatric community-acquired septic shock. The overall\\\\nobjective is to identify modifiable factors related to the clinical course of children with septic shock as well as pre-\\\\nexisting child or environmental factors that may impact long-term morbidity and mortality. The central hypothesis\\\\nis that identifiable, modifiable factors during pediatric community-acquired septic shock may affect the risk of\\\\nlong-term morbidity and mortality among children encountering septic shock, as well as the risk of family\\\\ndysfunction and psychological distress among their caregivers. The expected outcomes of the research are new\\\\nknowledge about factors contributing to adverse child and family outcomes following pediatric septic shock. This\\\\nnew knowledge will have a positive impact because it will provide an evidence-base for the development and\\\\ntesting of new interventions targeted at modifiable factors. The specific aims of this project are Aim 1) Identify\\\\nbaseline characteristics that are associated with impaired long-term functional status and health-related quality\\\\nof life among children following community-acquired septic shock. Aim 2) Identify aspects of the clinical course\\\\nthat are associated with impaired long-term functional status and health-related quality of life among children\\\\nfollowing community-acquired septic shock. Aim 3) Identify factors associated with long-term family functioning\\\\nand psychological distress of the primary caregiver following their child\\\\u2019s hospitalization for community-acquired\\\\nseptic shock. The approach to address these aims is to collaborate with junior investigators and their local\\\\nmentors from several academic institutions to answer important questions about pediatric sepsis using a publicly\\\\navailable dataset from the NIH-funded Life After Pediatric Sepsis Evaluation (LAPSE) study. Junior investigators\\\\nwill be provided with complete biostatistical support and additional mentorship from experts in pediatric sepsis\\\\nand the LAPSE study. This contribution is significant because it will provide an evidence basis for designing\\\\ndefinitive clinical trials and developing clinical protocols that address modifiable factors to optimizing care and\\\\nimproving long-term child and family outcomes following septic shock. The research proposed is innovative\\\\nbecause it will result in a substantial departure from the status quo by introducing junior investigators to the\\\\nbenefits of using established public use databases and providing them with an educational experience in their\\\\nuse.\", \"project_title\": \"Utilizing publicly available data to improve long-term quality of life following pediatric sepsis while fostering a new generation of sepsis investigators\", \"phr_text\": \"PROJECT NARRATIVE\\\\nThe proposed research is relevant to public health because it will provide an evidence-base for the development\\\\nand testing of new interventions targeted at modifiable factors associated with long-term quality of life following\\\\npediatric sepsis.

Using data from the Utah Population Database, we can measure residential PM2.5 exposure at the\\\\naddress level for our sample. We will: 1) Investigate the association between short-term PM2.5 and CV and\\\\nrespiratory health events among AYA cancer survivors, and compare survivors\\\\u2019 risk of PM2.5-associated health\\\\nevents to a cancer-free sample, and 2) Determine whether treatments with known toxicities modify the\\\\nassociation between short-term PM2.5 and CV and respiratory health events among AYA cancer survivors. We\\\\nwill identify temporal trends in these associations among survivors from diagnosis to the end of follow-up.\\\\nSubgroups of survivors will be investigated to determine differences by smoking, race/ethnicity, and other\\\\nrelevant factors. Utah has severe PM2.5 pollution due to winter inversions and summer wildfires. Because of the\\\\npervasiveness of air pollution in United States and the lack of data on how environmental pollutants affect\\\\ncancer survivors, this project represents a unique opportunity to determine whether air pollution is a risk factor\\\\nfor cardiovascular and respiratory health problems among AYA cancer survivors. Our study will provide a deep\\\\nexamination of cancer treatment, health care utilization, and PM2.5 exposure, and expand upon the established\\\\nperspective of survivorship research by adding information the role air pollution on the risk for health events\\\\namong cancer survivors.\", \"project_title\": \"Identifying the role of short-term fine particulate matter air pollution in the heart and lung health outcomes of adolescent and young adult cancer survivors\", \"phr_text\": \"PROJECT NARRATIVE\\\\nCancer therapies can damage the lung and heart tissue of adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer survivors,\\\\nresulting in major health problems after therapy ends. Breathing air pollution also damages lung and heart\\\\ntissue and may cause additional health problems for survivors.

There are\\\\nno current therapies to relieve vaso-occlusion, with interventions limited to hydration and analgesia. Nitric oxide\\\\n(NO), produced by the 5-electron oxidation of L-arginine, is a potent vasodilator and exerts pleiotropic effects on\\\\nvascular and circulating blood cells, including the inhibition of platelet aggregation, down-regulation of adhesion\\\\nmolecules, and modulation of ischemia-reperfusion injury, all pathways adversely affected during VOE. We have\\\\nfound that pediatric SCD patients admitted with VOE have depleted plasma L-arginine levels. Additionally, we\\\\nhave now completed a single-center randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of arginine therapy in\\\\n54 children with VOE requiring hospitalization. We observed a reduction in total opioid use (mg/kg) by 54% and\\\\nsigni\\\\ufb01cantly lower pain scores at discharge in children who received 5 days IV L-arginine therapy every 8 hours\\\\ncompared to placebo, as well as a clinically relevant trend in reduced length of hospital stay of approximately\\\\n17 hours.

visits, and missed school, and are associated with an increased mortality rate. There are\\\\nno current therapies to relieve vaso-occlusion, with interventions limited to hydration and analgesia. Nitric oxide\\\\n(NO), produced by the 5-electron oxidation of L-arginine, is a potent vasodilator and exerts pleiotropic effects on\\\\nvascular and circulating blood cells, including the inhibition of platelet aggregation, down-regulation of adhesion\\\\nmolecules, and modulation of ischemia-reperfusion injury, all pathways adversely affected during VOE. We have\\\\nfound that pediatric SCD patients admitted with VOE have depleted plasma L-arginine levels. Additionally, we\\\\nhave now completed a single-center randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of arginine therapy in\\\\n54 children with VOE requiring hospitalization. We observed a reduction in total opioid use (mg/kg) by 54% and\\\\nsigni\\\\ufb01cantly lower pain scores at discharge in children who received 5 days IV L-arginine therapy every 8 hours\\\\ncompared to placebo, as well as a clinically relevant trend in reduced length of hospital stay of approximately\\\\n17 hours. In pharmacokinetic studies, we found that IV arginine induced a dose-dependent improvement in\\\\nmitochondrial function in children with SCD hospitalized for pain. We now propose to extend these results to a\\\\npivotal phase 3 trial of L-arginine for VOE. We hypothesize that arginine is a safe intervention with narcotic-sparing\\\\neffects in pediatric SCD patients with VOE that will decrease the time children experience severe pain. Aim 1 of\\\\nthis study will determine the ef\\\\ufb01cacy of IV arginine therapy on the primary endpoint, time-to-crisis resolution, as\\\\nwell as total parenteral opioid use (mg/kg) and pain scores in children with SCD and VOE compared to placebo\\\\n(Ef\\\\ufb01cacy). Aim 2 will monitor for safety of IV L-arginine (Safety). Aim 3 will characterize alterations in the\\\\narginine metabolome and mitochondrial function in children with SCD and VOE, and evaluate how it is impacted\\\\nby IV arginine therapy (Exploratory). This proposal will provide essential data for product development and FDA\\\\nregulatory approval for use of arginine in SCD. Acute care of patients with SCD and pain in the ED is a neglected\\\\narea of research. The results of this study may ultimately lead to change in clinical practice for children with SCD\\\\nin both the ED and inpatient hospital wards. ED-based studies and novel therapies that target mechanisms of\\\\nvaso-occlusion and pain are needed in SCD.\", \"project_title\": \"2/2: Sickle Cell Disease Treatment with Arginine Therapy (STArT) trial\", \"phr_text\": \"Project Narrative\\\\nPain is the hallmark of sickle cell disease (SCD), and is the leading cause of hospitalizations, emergency room\\\\nvisits, missed school, and is associated with an increased death rate.

have wheezing episodes that are severe enough to require Emergency\\\\nDepartment (ED) visits each year in the United States, and 15% of these children require hospitalization. There\\\\nis new evidence suggesting that harmful bacteria growing in the throat may play an important role in determining\\\\nwhich preschoolers will wheeze and then go on to develop asthma. Bacteria and viruses are equally associated\\\\nwith the risk of acute episodes of wheezing in preschoolers, and antibiotics may be a potential treatment. Two\\\\nlarge, well-designed clinical trials performed in outpatient clinics recently showed a signi\\\\ufb01cant reduction in severe\\\\nsymptoms when children were treated with the antibiotic Azithromycin (AZ) either before or after they started\\\\nwheezing. Though these results are encouraging, we are not sure how this bene\\\\ufb01t occurs since AZ has both\\\\nanti-bacterial and anti-in\\\\ufb02ammatory effects. In addition, we do not know if AZ could be effective in more severe\\\\ncases, like those requiring ED visits. The relatively underprivileged preschoolers who present to the ED for care\\\\nof their severe wheezing episodes are usually sicker and with greater risk factors for bacterial infections. They\\\\nare, therefore, the population that may get the greatest bene\\\\ufb01t, if AZ is shown to be effective in this setting. We\\\\npropose a trial in preschool age children coming to the ED with severe wheezing who will be treated with either\\\\nAZ or placebo. We will also determine which bacteria are growing in the children\\'s pharynx.

We will thus determine if genetic\\\\nfactors or the populations of microbes present in the pharynx can identify children that are more likely to respond\\\\nto AZ. This will allow us to target the use of AZ to these children in the future.

have wheezing episodes that are severe enough to require Emergency\\\\nDepartment (ED) visits each year in the United States, and 15% of these children require hospitalization. There\\\\nis new evidence suggesting that harmful bacteria growing in the throat may play an important role in determining\\\\nwhich preschoolers will wheeze and then go on to develop asthma. Bacteria and viruses are equally associated\\\\nwith the risk of acute episodes of wheezing in preschoolers, and antibiotics may be a potential treatment. Two\\\\nlarge, well-designed clinical trials performed in outpatient clinics recently showed a signi\\\\ufb01cant reduction in severe\\\\nsymptoms when children were treated with the antibiotic Azithromycin (AZ) either before or after they started\\\\nwheezing. Though these results are encouraging, we are not sure how this bene\\\\ufb01t occurs since AZ has both\\\\nanti-bacterial and anti-in\\\\ufb02ammatory effects. In addition, we do not know if AZ could be effective in more severe\\\\ncases, like those requiring ED visits. The relatively underprivileged preschoolers who present to the ED for care\\\\nof their severe wheezing episodes are usually sicker and with greater risk factors for bacterial infections. They\\\\nare, therefore, the population that may get the greatest bene\\\\ufb01t, if AZ is shown to be effective in this setting. We\\\\npropose a trial in preschool age children coming to the ED with severe wheezing who will be treated with either\\\\nAZ or placebo. We will also determine which bacteria are growing in the children\\'s pharynx. This will answer the\\\\nquestion \\\\u201cDoes Azithromycin make children with severe wheezing better sooner and, if so, is that bene\\\\ufb01t seen\\\\nin all the children treated or only in those with potentially harmful bacteria in their throats?\\\\u201d There is concern\\\\nthat excessive use of antibiotics may cause bacterial resistance to their effects. We will thus determine if genetic\\\\nfactors or the populations of microbes present in the pharynx can identify children that are more likely to respond\\\\nto AZ. This will allow us to target the use of AZ to these children in the future. By testing treatment of high risk\\\\nchildren with severe wheezing in the ED with AZ and determining which bacteria are growing in their throats, our\\\\nstudy may identify a new way to treat these severe, frightening, and dif\\\\ufb01cult to treat illnesses.\", \"project_title\": \"2/2: AZithromycin Therapy in Preschoolers with a Severe Wheezing Episode Diagnosed at the Emergency Department (AZ-SWED)\", \"phr_text\": \"Project Narrative\\\\nThe proposed project is a multicenter clinical trial that seeks to determine the ef\\\\ufb01cacy of Azithromycin for the\\\\ntreatment of severe wheezing in preschoolers who present to the Emergency Department.

pollution are major risk factors for respiratory and cardiovascular\\\\ndisease and death. For survivors of testicular cancer, one of the most common and curable cancers occurring\\\\nin young men, respiratory and cardiovascular conditions often arise shortly after their treatment ceases. These\\\\nhealth conditions are attributed to the chemotherapies used to cure testicular cancer that also exhibit toxic\\\\neffects on heart and lung tissue. Post-treatment exposure to air pollution among testicular cancer survivors\\\\nmay exacerbate previous damage from chemotherapy, leading to a higher risk for respiratory and\\\\ncardiovascular problems. The effects of air pollution exposure on testicular cancer survivors, however, are\\\\nunknown. To fill this knowledge gap, we will examine how air pollution is associated with respiratory and\\\\ncardiovascular health care encounters among 1,293 testicular cancer survivors diagnosed between 1999 and\\\\n2017 who live in Utah, a state with severe air pollution problems. Using the nation\\\\u2019s only statewide population\\\\nregistry, the Utah Population Database (UPDB), we can link individual identifying information from statewide\\\\nadministrative data, statewide hospital and ambulatory surgery records, and outpatient medical records from\\\\nUtah\\\\u2019s largest health systems to residential data on short-term air pollution exposure for both PM2.5 and O3. We\\\\nwill: 1) Investigate the association of short-term air pollution exposure with respiratory and cardiovascular\\\\nhealth events among testicular cancer survivors, measured through statewide healthcare encounter data, and\\\\ncompare the risk between survivors and a cancer-free sample, and 2) Investigate treatments and health\\\\nbehaviors that may modify the relationship between air pollution exposure and respiratory and cardiovascular\\\\nevents among testicular cancer survivors. We will also assess how the relationship varies over time. Both aims\\\\nwill use a case-crossover design to examine the effects of short-term pollution exposure on the risk for\\\\nrespiratory and cardiovascular-associated outpatient, urgent care, and emergency department visits and\\\\nhospitalizations. We will also examine how risk differs among subgroups of survivors based on treatment (e.g.,\\\\nsurgery alone vs. surgery and chemotherapy), smoking, time since diagnosis, race/ethnicity, and other factors.\\\\nBecause of the pervasiveness of air pollution in United States and the lack of data on how environmental\\\\npollutants affect vulnerable populations such as cancer survivors, this project represents a unique opportunity\\\\nto determine whether air pollution is a risk factor for respiratory and cardiovascular health problems among\\\\ntesticular cancer survivors. Moreover, our findings will have implications for other populations of cancer\\\\nsurvivors and can help inform cancer survivorship guidelines on reducing air pollution exposure.\", \"project_title\": \"Identifying the role of air pollution in the lung and heart health outcomes of testicular cancer survivors\", \"phr_text\": \"PROJECT NARRATIVE\\\\nCancer therapies can damage the lung and heart tissue of testicular cancer survivors, resulting in major health\\\\nproblems after therapy ends.

science in the Cardiovascular\\\\nDevelopment Consortium (CvDC), sequencing the genomes of clinically phenotyped children with CHD and\\\\ntheir parents in the Pediatric Cardiac Genomics Consortium (PCGC), and long-term clinical follow-up and\\\\noutcomes research in the Pediatric Heart Network (PHN). The advent of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)\\\\nhas rapidly accelerated discoveries in cardiovascular development and the genetics and epigenetics of CHD.\\\\nBoth the CvDC and the PCGC have extensive NGS datasets. The CvDC DataHub at the University of Utah\\\\ncurrently serves as the programmatic data warehouse and distribution server that organizes NGS datasets and\\\\nmakes them available online. CvDC datasets are complex, containing NGS experiments from seven \\\\u2018model\\\\norganism\\\\u2019 species (mice, zebrafish, humans, alligator, turtle, chicken, sheep and frogs) and humans.\\\\nImportantly, the experiments in the CvDC explore the molecular etiology of cardiovascular development\\\\nthrough several coordinated -omics approaches, studying changes in the whole-genome transcriptome and in\\\\nthe epigenome (chromatin modifiers, transcription factors, the DNA methylome and higher-order organization\\\\nof chromatin) during cardiac development and in several mutant genetic backgrounds.\\\\nThe Cardiovascular Development Data Resource Center (CDDRC) will be built on the innovative Mosaic\\\\nplatform to provide a cloud-based collaborative space for organizing, visualizing and understanding genomic\\\\ndata, and for pointing analytic tools to datasets housed anywhere on the cloud. The CDDRC is designed by\\\\nexperts in computational sciences and bioinformatics, in consultation with leaders in the CvDC, PCGC and\\\\nPHN to be used by non-experts, basic scientists, human geneticists and clinicians. The University of Utah is\\\\none of a few institutions in the country that has leadership in all three B2B consortia, reflecting the depth and\\\\ndiversity of our expertise and our commitment to cross-disciplinary collaborations. The CDDRC will provide a\\\\nsuite of cloud-compatible tools and a coordinated and a harmonized set of datasets transported from the\\\\nprevious CvDC DataHub, imported from current CvDC projects, and recruited from the cardiovascular\\\\ndevelopment and pediatric CHD research communities. The CDDRC will facilitate dynamic and investigator-\\\\ninteractive interfaces with multiple -omics datasets from humans and multiple model organisms, resulting in\\\\ncollaborative discoveries of the genetic and epigenetic causes of CHD.

the United States.\\\\nThe NHLBI has made significant investments to discover the causes and outcomes of CHD, including research\\\\nin the Bench-to-Bassinet (B2B) Consortia that spans fundamental discovery science in the Cardiovascular\\\\nDevelopment Consortium (CvDC), sequencing the genomes of clinically phenotyped children with CHD and\\\\ntheir parents in the Pediatric Cardiac Genomics Consortium (PCGC), and long-term clinical follow-up and\\\\noutcomes research in the Pediatric Heart Network (PHN). The advent of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)\\\\nhas rapidly accelerated discoveries in cardiovascular development and the genetics and epigenetics of CHD.\\\\nBoth the CvDC and the PCGC have extensive NGS datasets. The CvDC DataHub at the University of Utah\\\\ncurrently serves as the programmatic data warehouse and distribution server that organizes NGS datasets and\\\\nmakes them available online. CvDC datasets are complex, containing NGS experiments from seven \\\\u2018model\\\\norganism\\\\u2019 species (mice, zebrafish, humans, alligator, turtle, chicken, sheep and frogs) and humans.\\\\nImportantly, the experiments in the CvDC explore the molecular etiology of cardiovascular development\\\\nthrough several coordinated -omics approaches, studying changes in the whole-genome transcriptome and in\\\\nthe epigenome (chromatin modifiers, transcription factors, the DNA methylome and higher-order organization\\\\nof chromatin) during cardiac development and in several mutant genetic backgrounds.\\\\nThe Cardiovascular Development Data Resource Center (CDDRC) will be built on the innovative Mosaic\\\\nplatform to provide a cloud-based collaborative space for organizing, visualizing and understanding genomic\\\\ndata, and for pointing analytic tools to datasets housed anywhere on the cloud. The CDDRC is designed by\\\\nexperts in computational sciences and bioinformatics, in consultation with leaders in the CvDC, PCGC and\\\\nPHN to be used by non-experts, basic scientists, human geneticists and clinicians. The University of Utah is\\\\none of a few institutions in the country that has leadership in all three B2B consortia, reflecting the depth and\\\\ndiversity of our expertise and our commitment to cross-disciplinary collaborations. The CDDRC will provide a\\\\nsuite of cloud-compatible tools and a coordinated and a harmonized set of datasets transported from the\\\\nprevious CvDC DataHub, imported from current CvDC projects, and recruited from the cardiovascular\\\\ndevelopment and pediatric CHD research communities. The CDDRC will facilitate dynamic and investigator-\\\\ninteractive interfaces with multiple -omics datasets from humans and multiple model organisms, resulting in\\\\ncollaborative discoveries of the genetic and epigenetic causes of CHD.

this proposal is to explore the molecular and electrophysiological role of NFATC1 as a novel\\\\natrial fibrillation (AF) susceptibility gene and to define the previously unknown contribution of NFATC1 to atrial\\\\nexcitability. AF, the most common sustained arrhythmia encountered in clinical practice, has an economic burden\\\\nexceeding $7 billion in annual health care costs. Emerging evidence implicates cardiac transcription factors in\\\\nthe pathogenesis in both familial forms of AF and AF in the general population. We identified a mutation in the\\\\ncardiac transcription factor NFATC1 in a high-risk Utah pedigree defined by young onset AF. NFATC1 is a Ca2+-\\\\ndependent transcription factor postulated to play a role in cardiac development, but up until now has never been\\\\nassociated with cardiac excitability. Our exciting preliminary data identify a novel role for NFATC1 in modulating\\\\natrial excitability, in that nfatc1 null zebrafish develop spontaneous atrial tachyarrhythmia and juvenile sudden\\\\ndeath. Aim 1 seeks to define the biochemical, molecular and electrophysiological basis of the mutant NFATC1\\\\ndysfunction, using the HL-1 atrial cell line, a human cell culture model (patient-specific and genome-edited\\\\ninduced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes, iPSC-CMs), and a whole animal model (transgenic\\\\nzebrafish). Aim 2 characterizes the role of NFATC1 in modulating atrial excitability by exploring the molecular\\\\nand electrophysiological basis for the atrial tachyarrhythmia in nfatc1 null zebrafish. Aim 3 will define NFATC1-\\\\ncontrolled transcriptional networks and gene pathways that regulate cardiac excitability, using single-cell RNA-\\\\nSeq, ChIP-Seq and ChIP-Mass Spectroscopy in human atrium and NFATC1 null and WT iPSC-CMs.\\\\nOur proposal leverages human genetics, genome-editing techniques, state-of-the-art Next-Gen sequencing\\\\nmodalities and bioinformatics, and electrophysiology to comprehensively characterize the novel role of NFATC1\\\\nin cardiac excitability and AF pathogenesis. An understanding of a key transcriptional network that regulates ion\\\\nchannel gene expression and atrial excitability will provide a broader, and more comprehensive understanding\\\\nof arrhythmia susceptibility and lay the foundation for novel AF therapies.\", \"project_title\": \"A Novel Role for NFATC1 in Modulating Cardiac Excitability\", \"phr_text\": \"PROJECT NARRATIVE\\\\nThe overall goal of this proposal is to explore the molecular and electrophysiological role of NFATC1 as a novel\\\\natrial fibrillation susceptibility gene and to define the previously unknown contribution of NFATC1 to atrial\\\\nexcitability.

\"PROJECT SUMMARY Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of acquired neurologic disability in\\\\nchildren; yet, no effective therapies exist. Secondary injury from inflammation increases neurologic disability\\\\nfrom damage after impact. Microglia (the brain\\'s resident immune cells) mediate inflammatory release of\\\\nreactive oxygen species (ROS) and cytotoxic factors early after TBI. Microglia that become reparatory remove\\\\ndebris by phagocytosis and resolve inflammation. The immature brain is highly vulnerable to secondary injury\\\\ndue to its low antioxidant reserve and vigorous inflammatory response. Agents that move microglia away from\\\\ninflammatory towards reparatory activity may decrease neurologic disability after TBI, particularly in children.\\\\nDocosahexaenoic Acid, or DHA, is a candidate therapy for childhood TBI. DHA is a fatty acid essential for\\\\nnormal brain growth and function that has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity. In rats, DHA restores\\\\nbrain DHA losses after TBI. In cultured microglia, DHA promotes reparatory activity. Using our pediatric TBI\\\\nmodel, controlled cortical impact (CCI) in male 17-day old (P17) rats, DHA diet before CCI reduced learning\\\\ndeficits (Morris Water Maze, MWM) brain lesion volume and white matter injury (histology and MRI, Magnetic\\\\nResonance Imaging). We also showed that DHA given after CCI improved rat pup outcomes. Intraperitoneal\\\\n(IP) DHA at 30 minutes after CCI, followed by up to 60 days of DHA diet, decreased ROS, microglial\\\\ninflammatory genes at post injury day 7(PID7) and memory dysfunction (Novel Object Recognition, NOR).\\\\nWhether DHA affects brain inflammatory markers in female pups, or if DHA affects microglial activity (ROS\\\\nproduction and phagocytosis) after TBI in either sex, is unknown. Similarly, whether delayed (later than 30 min\\\\nafter CCI) or short (7-day course) DHA will retain acute and chronic neuroprotection, is not known. Finally, little\\\\nis known about how DHA may modulate microglial activation after TBI. We hypothesize that either DHA at 30\\\\nmin or 3h after CCI will decrease PID7 microglial inflammation in males and that only long term DHA will\\\\nimprove PID45-60 outcomes in both sexes. We hypothesize that DHA will decrease PID7 inflammation\\\\nassociated with decreased TLR4 and activated STAT1 proteins on cell membranes and caspase activity. We\\\\nwill use male and female P17 rat pups and CCI or sham surgery. We will compare onset of DHA (30 min or 3h)\\\\nand duration (7 days to 60 days) to control. During week 1 after CCI, we will use cell membrane assays, tissue\\\\nand microglial protein markers, and microglial activity to assess inflammation. From PID 45 to 60 we will use\\\\nNOR/ MWM testing, histology and MRI for functional, anatomic and inflammatory outcomes. This proposal is\\\\nsignificant because it focuses on the immature brain after severe TBI, a devastating condition for which no\\\\neffective therapies exist. It will yield new knowledge on the effects of sex and DHA on microglial function after\\\\nTBI and on optimal DHA initiation and duration timing. Results will enable future clinical trials of DHA with the\\\\npotential to decrease the burden of pediatric acquired neurologic injury after TBI.\", \"project_title\": \"Microglial Function and Neurologic Outcome in Rat Pups after Experimental Traumatic Brain Injury: Effects of Timing and Duration of Docosahexaenoic Acid Therapy\", \"phr_text\": \"PROJECT NARRATIVE\\\\nWe will use male and female rat pups to study inflammation in the young brain after traumatic brain injury\\\\n(TBI).

proposal is to explore the molecular and electrophysiological role of NFATC1 as a novel\\\\natrial fibrillation (AF) susceptibility gene and to define the previously unknown contribution of NFATC1 to atrial\\\\nexcitability. AF, the most common sustained arrhythmia encountered in clinical practice, has an economic burden\\\\nexceeding $7 billion in annual health care costs. Emerging evidence implicates cardiac transcription factors in\\\\nthe pathogenesis in both familial forms of AF and AF in the general population. We identified a mutation in the\\\\ncardiac transcription factor NFATC1 in a high-risk Utah pedigree defined by young onset AF. NFATC1 is a Ca2+-\\\\ndependent transcription factor postulated to play a role in cardiac development, but up until now has never been\\\\nassociated with cardiac excitability. Our exciting preliminary data identify a novel role for NFATC1 in modulating\\\\natrial excitability, in that nfatc1 null zebrafish develop spontaneous atrial tachyarrhythmia and juvenile sudden\\\\ndeath. Aim 1 seeks to define the biochemical, molecular and electrophysiological basis of the mutant NFATC1\\\\ndysfunction, using the HL-1 atrial cell line, a human cell culture model (patient-specific and genome-edited\\\\ninduced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes, iPSC-CMs), and a whole animal model (transgenic\\\\nzebrafish). Aim 2 characterizes the role of NFATC1 in modulating atrial excitability by exploring the molecular\\\\nand electrophysiological basis for the atrial tachyarrhythmia in nfatc1 null zebrafish. Aim 3 will define NFATC1-\\\\ncontrolled transcriptional networks and gene pathways that regulate cardiac excitability, using single-cell RNA-\\\\nSeq, ChIP-Seq and ChIP-Mass Spectroscopy in human atrium and NFATC1 null and WT iPSC-CMs.\\\\nOur proposal leverages human genetics, genome-editing techniques, state-of-the-art Next-Gen sequencing\\\\nmodalities and bioinformatics, and electrophysiology to comprehensively characterize the novel role of NFATC1\\\\nin cardiac excitability and AF pathogenesis. An understanding of a key transcriptional network that regulates ion\\\\nchannel gene expression and atrial excitability will provide a broader, and more comprehensive understanding\\\\nof arrhythmia susceptibility and lay the foundation for novel AF therapies.\", \"project_title\": \"A Novel Role for NFATC1 in Modulating Cardiac Excitability\", \"phr_text\": \"PROJECT NARRATIVE\\\\nThe overall goal of this proposal is to explore the molecular and electrophysiological role of NFATC1 as a novel\\\\natrial fibrillation susceptibility gene and to define the previously unknown contribution of NFATC1 to atrial\\\\nexcitability.

Secondary injury from inflammation increases neurologic disability\\\\nfrom damage after impact.

Microglia that become reparatory remove\\\\ndebris by phagocytosis and resolve inflammation. The immature brain is highly vulnerable to secondary injury\\\\ndue to its low antioxidant reserve and vigorous inflammatory response.

DHA is a fatty acid essential for\\\\nnormal brain growth and function that has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity. In rats, DHA restores\\\\nbrain DHA losses after TBI. In cultured microglia, DHA promotes reparatory activity. Using our pediatric TBI\\\\nmodel, controlled cortical impact (CCI) in male 17-day old (P17) rats, DHA diet before CCI reduced learning\\\\ndeficits (Morris Water Maze, MWM) brain lesion volume and white matter injury (histology and MRI, Magnetic\\\\nResonance Imaging). We also showed that DHA given after CCI improved rat pup outcomes. Intraperitoneal\\\\n(IP) DHA at 30 minutes after CCI, followed by up to 60 days of DHA diet, decreased ROS, microglial\\\\ninflammatory genes at post injury day 7(PID7) and memory dysfunction (Novel Object Recognition, NOR).\\\\nWhether DHA affects brain inflammatory markers in female pups, or if DHA affects microglial activity (ROS\\\\nproduction and phagocytosis) after TBI in either sex, is unknown. Similarly, whether delayed (later than 30 min\\\\nafter CCI) or short (7-day course) DHA will retain acute and chronic neuroprotection, is not known. Finally, little\\\\nis known about how DHA may modulate microglial activation after TBI. We hypothesize that either DHA at 30\\\\nmin or 3h after CCI will decrease PID7 microglial inflammation in males and that only long term DHA will\\\\nimprove PID45-60 outcomes in both sexes. We hypothesize that DHA will decrease PID7 inflammation\\\\nassociated with decreased TLR4 and activated STAT1 proteins on cell membranes and caspase activity. We\\\\nwill use male and female P17 rat pups and CCI or sham surgery. We will compare onset of DHA (30 min or 3h)\\\\nand duration (7 days to 60 days) to control. During week 1 after CCI, we will use cell membrane assays, tissue\\\\nand microglial protein markers, and microglial activity to assess inflammation. From PID 45 to 60 we will use\\\\nNOR/ MWM testing, histology and MRI for functional, anatomic and inflammatory outcomes. This proposal is\\\\nsignificant because it focuses on the immature brain after severe TBI, a devastating condition for which no\\\\neffective therapies exist.

susceptibility gene and to define the previously unknown contribution of NFATC1 to atrial\\\\nexcitability. AF, the most common sustained arrhythmia encountered in clinical practice, has an economic burden\\\\nexceeding $7 billion in annual health care costs. Emerging evidence implicates cardiac transcription factors in\\\\nthe pathogenesis in both familial forms of AF and AF in the general population. We identified a mutation in the\\\\ncardiac transcription factor NFATC1 in a high-risk Utah pedigree defined by young onset AF. NFATC1 is a Ca2+-\\\\ndependent transcription factor postulated to play a role in cardiac development, but up until now has never been\\\\nassociated with cardiac excitability. Our exciting preliminary data identify a novel role for NFATC1 in modulating\\\\natrial excitability, in that nfatc1 null zebrafish develop spontaneous atrial tachyarrhythmia and juvenile sudden\\\\ndeath. Aim 1 seeks to define the biochemical, molecular and electrophysiological basis of the mutant NFATC1\\\\ndysfunction, using the HL-1 atrial cell line, a human cell culture model (patient-specific and genome-edited\\\\ninduced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes, iPSC-CMs), and a whole animal model (transgenic\\\\nzebrafish). Aim 2 characterizes the role of NFATC1 in modulating atrial excitability by exploring the molecular\\\\nand electrophysiological basis for the atrial tachyarrhythmia in nfatc1 null zebrafish. Aim 3 will define NFATC1-\\\\ncontrolled transcriptional networks and gene pathways that regulate cardiac excitability, using single-cell RNA-\\\\nSeq, ChIP-Seq and ChIP-Mass Spectroscopy in human atrium and NFATC1 null and WT iPSC-CMs.\\\\nOur proposal leverages human genetics, genome-editing techniques, state-of-the-art Next-Gen sequencing\\\\nmodalities and bioinformatics, and electrophysiology to comprehensively characterize the novel role of NFATC1\\\\nin cardiac excitability and AF pathogenesis. An understanding of a key transcriptional network that regulates ion\\\\nchannel gene expression and atrial excitability will provide a broader, and more comprehensive understanding\\\\nof arrhythmia susceptibility and lay the foundation for novel AF therapies.\", \"project_title\": \"A Novel Role for NFATC1 in Modulating Cardiac Excitability\", \"phr_text\": \"PROJECT NARRATIVE\\\\nThe overall goal of this proposal is to explore the molecular and electrophysiological role of NFATC1 as a novel\\\\natrial fibrillation susceptibility gene and to define the previously unknown contribution of NFATC1 to atrial\\\\nexcitability.

Detecting GBM recurrence is also challenging as treatment\\\\neffects such as pseudoprogression and radiation necrosis mimic recurrent disease. Thus, risk-associated\\\\ndiagnostic invasive procedures remain a critical aspect of GBM patient care even though surgically acquired\\\\nneurologic deficits may reduce an already short survival time. Therefore, a non-invasive approach to diagnose\\\\nGBM and identify true recurrence has the potential to directly impact patient care throughout the entire disease\\\\ncourse.

Detection of tumor-derived cell-\\\\nfree DNA in plasma, also known as circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), has previously been largely unsuccessful\\\\nin humans with GBM due to an inability to find the ctDNA amongst the abundant background of normally\\\\noccurring cell-free DNA. The large intra- and inter-tumor genetic heterogeneity of GBM has hindered searches\\\\nfor specific tumor variants in cell-free DNA, while the rarity of GBM to metastasize beyond the central nervous\\\\nsystem has considerably restricted the quantity of ctDNA present.

Thus, risk-associated\\\\ndiagnostic invasive procedures remain a critical aspect of GBM patient care even though surgically acquired\\\\nneurologic deficits may reduce an already short survival time. Therefore, a non-invasive approach to diagnose\\\\nGBM and identify true recurrence has the potential to directly impact patient care throughout the entire disease\\\\ncourse.

Children supported with\\\\nECLS receive numerous drugs to treat critical illness and the underlying disease. Unfortunately, the majority of\\\\ndrugs prescribed to children on ECLS lack dosing information. Our preliminary data demonstrate that dosing is\\\\ndifferent in this population because the ECLS circuit components, like filters and tubing, as well as physiologic\\\\nalterations triggered by critical illness affect drug disposition substantially. The lack of appropriate dosing\\\\ninformation is an urgent, unmet public health need that can result in therapeutic failure and death.
