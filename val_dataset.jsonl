These costs may be reimbursed only to the extent considered allowable pre-award costs.\n    \n \n    Any application awarded in response to this NOFO will be subject to terms and conditions found on the\n     \n     Award Conditions and Information for NIH Grants\n     \n    website.\u00a0 This includes any recent legislation and policy applicable to awards that is highlighted on this website.\n    \n \n \n \n    Institutional Review Board or Independent Ethics Committee Approval: Recipient institutions must ensure that protocols are reviewed by their IRB or IEC. To help ensure the safety of participants enrolled in NIH-funded studies, the recipient must provide NIH copies of documents related to all major changes in the status of ongoing protocols.\n    \n \n \n   2. Administrative and National Policy Requirements\n    \n    All NIH grant and cooperative agreement awards include the\n     \n     NIH Grants Policy Statement\n     \n    as part of the NoA. For these terms of award, see the\n     \n     NIH Grants Policy Statement Part II: Terms and Conditions of NIH Grant Awards, Subpart A: General\n     \n    and\n     \n     Part II: Terms and Conditions of NIH Grant Awards, Subpart B: Terms and Conditions for Specific Types of Grants, Recipients, and Activities\n     \n    , including of note, but not limited to:\n    \n \n \n \n      Federal-wide Standard Terms and Conditions for Research Grants\n      \n \n \n \n      Prohibition on Certain Telecommunications and Video Surveillance Services or Equipment\n      \n \n \n \n      Acknowledgment of Federal Funding\n      \n \n \n \n    If a recipient is successful and receives a Notice of Award, in accepting the award, the recipient agrees that any activities under the award are subject to all provisions currently in effect or implemented during the period of the award, other Department regulations and policies in effect at the time of the award, and applicable statutory provisions.\n    \n \n    If a recipient receives an award, the recipient must follow all applicable nondiscrimination laws. The recipient agrees to this when registering in SAM.gov. The recipient must also submit an Assurance of Compliance\n     \n     (\n     \n \n     HHS-690\n     \n    ). To learn more, see the\n     \n     HHS Office for Civil Rights website\n     \n    .\n    \n \n    HHS recognizes that NIH research projects are often limited in scope for many reasons that are nondiscriminatory, such as the principal investigator\u2019s scientific interest, funding limitations, recruitment requirements, and other considerations. Thus, criteria in research protocols that target or exclude certain populations are warranted where nondiscriminatory justifications establish that such criteria are appropriate with respect to the health or safety of the subjects, the scientific study design, or the purpose of the research. For additional guidance regarding how the provisions apply to NIH grant programs, please contact the Scientific/Research Contact that is identified in Section VII under Agency Contacts of this NOFO.\n    \n \n    In accordance with the statutory provisions contained in Section 872 of the Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 2009 (Public Law 110-417), NIH awards will be subject to the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS) requirements. FAPIIS requires Federal award making officials to review and consider information about an applicant in the designated integrity and performance system (currently FAPIIS) prior to making an award. An applicant, at its option, may review information in the designated integrity and performance systems accessible through FAPIIS and comment on any information about itself that a federal agency previously entered and is currently in FAPIIS. The Federal awarding agency will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to other information in FAPIIS, in making a judgement about the applicant\u2019s integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under Federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in 2 CFR Part 200.206 \u201cFederal awarding agency review of risk posed by applicants.\u201d This provision will apply to all NIH grants and cooperative agreements except fellowships.\n    \n \n \n   Cooperative Agreement Terms and Conditions of Award\n    \n    Not Applicable\n    \n \n \n   3. Data Management and Sharing\n    \n    Consistent with the 2023 NIH Policy for Data Management and Sharing, when data management and sharing is applicable to the award, recipients will be required to adhere to the Data Management and Sharing requirements as outlined in the\n     \n     NIH Grants Policy Statement\n     \n    . Upon the approval of a Data Management and Sharing Plan, it is required for recipients to implement the plan as described.\n    \n \n \n   4. Reporting\n    \n    When multiple years are involved, recipients will be required to submit the\n     \n     Research Performance Progress Report (RPPR)\n     \n    annually and financial statements as required in the\n     \n     NIH Grants Policy Statement\n     \n    .\n    \n \n \n \n    A final RPPR, invention statement, and the expenditure data portion of the Federal Financial Report are required for closeout of an award, as described in the\n     \n     NIH Grants Policy Statement\n     \n    . NIH NOFOs outline intended research goals and objectives. Post award, NIH will review and measure performance based on the details and outcomes that are shared within the RPPR, as described at 2 CFR Part 200.301.\n    \n \n    The Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006, as amended (FFATA), includes a requirement for recipients of Federal grants to report information about first-tier subawards and executive compensation under Federal assistance awards issued in FY2011 or later.\u00a0 All recipients of applicable NIH grants and cooperative agreements\u00a0are required to report to the Federal Subaward Reporting System (FSRS) available at\n     \n     www.fsrs.gov\n     \n    on all subawards over the threshold.\u00a0 See the\n     \n     NIH Grants Policy Statement\n     \n    for additional information on this reporting requirement.\n    \n \n    In accordance with the regulatory requirements provided 2 CFR Part 200.113 and Appendix XII to 2 CFR Part 200, recipients that have currently active Federal grants, cooperative agreements, and procurement contracts from all Federal awarding agencies with a cumulative total value greater than $10,000,000 for any period of time during the period of performance of a Federal award, must report and maintain the currency of information reported in the System for Award Management (SAM)\u00a0about civil, criminal, and administrative proceedings in connection with the award or performance of a Federal award that reached final disposition within the most recent five-year period.\u00a0 The recipient must also make semiannual disclosures regarding such proceedings.\u00a0Proceedings information will be made publicly available in the designated integrity and performance system (currently FAPIIS).\u00a0 This is a statutory requirement under section 872 of Public Law 110-417, as amended (41 U.S.C. 2313).\u00a0 As required by section 3010 of Public Law 111-212, all information posted in the designated integrity and performance system on or after April 15, 2011, except past performance reviews required for Federal procurement contracts, will be publicly available.\u00a0 Full reporting requirements and procedures are found in Appendix XII to 2 CFR Part 200 \u2013 Award Term and Condition\u00a0for Recipient Integrity and Performance Matters.\n    \n \n \n   5.

Studies appropriate for this NOFO will develop pharmacologic and neuromodulatory tools for basic and clinical research on mental health disorders; develop and validate tools (pharmacologic or neurostimulation) in support of experimental therapeutic studies of innovative candidates for mental disorders; and support early-stage human studies to rapidly assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacodynamics of promising drug candidates/devices and new indications for novel Investigational New Drug (IND)-ready agents or Investigational Device Exemption (IDE)-ready devices for the treatment of mental disorders. This NOFO encourages applications to advance the discovery, preclinical development, and proof of concept (PoC) testing of new, rationally based candidate agents and neurostimulation approaches to treat mental disorders, and to develop novel ligands and circuit-engagement devices as tools to further characterize existing or to validate new drug/device targets. Partnerships between academia and industry are strongly encouraged.\n    \n \n    This NOFO will also support applications proposing preclinical discovery of biotechnology products and biologics with potential as candidate therapeutics including, but not limited to, large biologic macromolecules, (e.g., proteins, antibodies, and peptides), gene-based therapies (i.e., oligonucleotide- and viral vector-based), cell therapies, and novel emerging therapies (e.g., microbial and microbiome therapies).\n    \n \n    This NOFO supports a discrete, specified, circumscribed project to be performed by the named investigator(s) in an area representing his or her specific interest and competencies. Projects seeking support for a research program of multiple projects directed toward a specific major objective, basic theme, or program goal, requiring a broadly based, multidisciplinary, and often long-term approach should consider the companion NOFO\n     \n     PAR-25-353\n     \n \n \n \n   Funding Opportunity Goal(s)\n    \n    The mission of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) is to transform the understanding and treatment of mental illnesses through basic and clinical research, paving the way for prevention, recovery, and cure.\n    \n This variable defines that we need to start a new row.", "e9b9c0f8-ae1b-414c-83c5-44ee59a28cb3": "PAR-25-352: National Cooperative Drug/Device Discovery/Development Groups (NCDDG) for the Treatment of Mental Disorders (U01 Clinical Trial Optional) Key Dates PAR-25-352: National Cooperative Drug/Device Discovery/Development Groups (NCDDG) for the Treatment of Mental Disorders (U01 Clinical Trial Optional) Key Dates\n    \n \n \n   Posted Date\n   January 15, 2025\n    \n \n   Open Date (Earliest Submission Date)\n   January 25, 2025\n    \n \n   Letter of Intent Due Date(s)\n    \n    30 days before the application due date\n    \n This variable defines that we need to start a new row.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       Application Due Dates\n       \n \n       Review and Award Cycles\n       \n \n \n \n       New\n       \n \n       Renewal / Resubmission / Revision (as allowed)\n       \n \n       AIDS - New/Renewal/Resubmission/Revision, as allowed\n       \n \n       Scientific Merit Review\n       \n \n       Advisory Council Review\n       \n \n       Earliest Start Date\n       \n \n \n \n \n \n       February 25, 2025\n       \n \n       February 25, 2025\n       \n \n       Not Applicable\n       \n \n       July 2025\n       \n \n       October 2025\n       \n \n       December 2025\n       \n \n \n \n       June 25, 2025\n       \n \n       June 25, 2025\n       \n \n       Not Applicable\n       \n \n       November 2025\n       \n \n       January 2026\n       \n \n       April 2026\n       \n \n \n \n       October 25, 2025\n       \n \n       October 25, 2025\n       \n \n       Not Applicable\n       \n \n       March 2026\n       \n \n       May 2026\n       \n \n       July 2026\n       \n \n \n \n       February 25, 2026\n       \n \n       February 25, 2026\n       \n \n       Not Applicable\n       \n \n       July 2026\n       \n \n       October 2026\n       \n \n       December 2026\n       \n \n \n \n       June 25, 2026\n       \n \n       June 25, 2026\n       \n \n       Not Applicable\n       \n \n       November 2026\n       \n \n       January 2027\n       \n \n       April 2027\n       \n \n \n \n       October 25, 2026\n       \n \n       October 25, 2026\n       \n \n       Not Applicable\n       \n \n       March 2027\n       \n \n       May 2027\n       \n \n       July 2027\n       \n \n \n \n       February 25, 2027\n       \n \n       February 25, 2027\n       \n \n       Not Applicable\n       \n \n       July 2027\n       \n \n       October 2027\n       \n \n       December 2027\n       \n \n \n \n       June 25, 2027\n       \n \n       June 25, 2027\n       \n \n       Not Applicable\n       \n \n       November 2027\n       \n \n       January 2028\n       \n \n       April 2028\n       \n \n \n \n       October 25, 2027\n       \n \n       October 25, 2027\n       \n \n       Not Applicable\n       \n \n       March 2028\n       \n \n       May 2028\n       \n \n       July 2028\n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    All applications are due by 5:00 PM local time of applicant organization.\n    \n \n    Applicants are encouraged to apply early to allow adequate time to make any corrections to errors found in the application during the submission process by the due date.\n    \n \n \n   Expiration Date\n   October 26, 2027\n    \n \n   Due Dates for E.O. 12372\n    \n    Not Applicable\n    \n This variable defines that we need to start a new row.  \n \n \n   Required Application Instructions\n    \n    It is critical that applicants follow the instructions in the Research (R) Instructions in the\n     \n     How to Apply - Application Guide\n     \n    , except where instructed to do otherwise (in this NOFO or in a Notice from\n     \n     NIH Guide for Grants and Contracts\n     \n    ).\n    \n \n    Conformance to all requirements (both in the Application Guide and the NOFO) is required and strictly enforced.

The objectives of this program are: to advance the discovery, preclinical development, early-stage human studies, and/or proof of concept testing of new, rationally based candidate agents or devices to treat mental disorders, and to develop novel ligands and novel brain circuit-modulatory technologies as tools to advance biological research on the function of genes, cells, biochemical pathways, distributed neural circuits, and neural oscillatory patterns implicated in the etiology and pathophysiology of mental disorders, and as potential new therapeutics. Partnerships between academia and industry are strongly encouraged. This program strongly encourages in-kind resource contributions of the partners within the NCDDG (e.g., biotechnology, pharmaceutical, or disease foundations).\n    \n \n    Each NCDDG program should consist of a multidisciplinary team of scientists with appropriate expertise to further the development and evaluation of novel candidate agents or proposed biomedical devices. Scientists from both academia and pharmaceutical industry are encouraged to participate within an NCDDG; scientists from foreign institutions and NIH Intramural laboratories may participate in some aspects. It is anticipated that the interaction of academic and non-profit research institutions with industry and NIH via the NCDDG model will: 1) accelerate the discovery and development of new therapeutics for mental disorders; 2) increase the availability of pharmacologic and device-based research tools (including Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) imaging agents) for basic and clinical research; 3) facilitate the development and validation of neurophysiological, pharmacokinetic (PK), and pharmacodynamic (PD) measures to evaluate novel therapeutics for mental disorders; 4) increase the availability of new compounds, agents, and devices suitable for testing in humans; 5) facilitate the development and validation of new clinical measures or biomarkers suitable for use in human Proof of Concept (PoC) trials of novel therapeutics for mental disorders; and/or 6) develop and validate novel neurostimulation technologies and protocols for mental disorders.\n    \n \n    The goal of the NCDDG program is not to duplicate or compete with the private sector but to complement and accelerate the development of research tools for new molecular and circuit targets implicated in mental disorders, and effective compounds, agents, and devices for the prevention and treatment of psychiatric and addictive disorders, as well as core features of these illnesses, especially in areas of unmet medical need.\n    \n \n \n     Background and Research Objectives\n     \n \n \n    Significant advances in neuroscience, genetics, genomics, and related omics, behavioral neuroscience, together with technological developments (structural biology,\n     \n     in silico\n     \n    and high throughput screening,\n     \n     in vivo\n     \n    imaging methods), have provided a rich knowledge base for understanding pathophysiology, identifying new molecular targets for drug discovery, new circuit/oscillatory targets for device development, and developing rational pharmacotherapies and neuromodulation interventions for the treatment of psychiatric disorders. With the wealth of potential new drug/device targets, the opportunity exists to accelerate the process of target validation and medication discovery to make great strides toward novel and effective treatments for mental disorders.\n    \n \n    A U01 application can include no more than a single Research Project. Applications proposing two or more Research Projects along with Scientific and/or Administrative Core components should respond to the companion NOFO utilizing the U19 mechanism (\n     \n     PAR-25-353\n     \n    )\n    \n \n \n     NIMH's Objectives and Interests for the NCDDG Program\n     \n \n \n    NIMH\u2019s objective for the NCDDG program is to support innovative, high impact research focused on the discovery of pharmacological agents selective for novel molecular targets and new neuromodulation devices targeting novel neural circuit and neural oscillatory targets with potential to prevent or reverse pathophysiological processes underlying mood and anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, eating disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, fragile x, autism, and other mental illnesses. Public-Private partnerships are particularly encouraged.\n    \n \n    NIMH-relevant NCDDG research projects should focus on novel interventions, using either pharmacological agents or neuromodulation devices that interrogate a molecular, circuit or clinical target that is linked to a biological mechanism or pathophysiology of the proposed mental disorder.\n    \n \n    The NIMH strongly encourages an experimental medicine approach to therapeutic development. This NOFO will support up through First-in-Human (FIH) for devices or Phase Ia or Ib trials for pharmacological agents. For these trials, studies are expected to assess the agent/device for 1) safety and tolerability, 2) target engagement, and 3) pharmacodynamic effects on relevant circuits or systems. Data resulting from Phase I trials in healthy controls and in the target patient population are expected to determine optimal clinical dosing and to establish feasibility for further testing in PoC and efficacy trials. Agents/devices should be sufficiently potent and selective for critical evaluation of target engagement and brain exposure. The agent/indication (if successful) should have a major, not merely incremental, impact on unmet medical need in psychiatric disorders. In support of this effort, NIMH recognizes the need for the timely development of new PET tracers for targets that are of interest for assessing target engagement/dose selection for clinical trials of novel therapeutics and for studies of the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders.\n    \n \n    Consistent with NIMH\u2019s Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative, research projects directed towards ameliorating pathophysiology that is potentially more proximal to specific functional deficits (domains) than Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) diagnostic entities are encouraged. Additional information about the RDoC approach can be found on the\n     \n     RDoC website\n     \n    . The testing of functional domains not included specifically in RDoC may also be considered, if well justified.\n    \n \n    NIMH encourages applications ranging from ligand discovery and testing in preclinical assays through human Phase I studies of novel agents. Examples include, but are not limited to:\n    \n \n \n     An application that integrates machine learning (ML) tools, including human-in-the-loop ML (an ML model that requires researcher interaction), into the drug discovery process at any of its stages, from hit/lead identification to lead optimization.\n      \n \n       Use of generative ML models in de-novo design of drug chemical structures with desired properties\n       \n \n       Ligand-based virtual screening and computational hit expansion following high-throughput screening (HTS) campaigns\n       \n \n       Use of ML in the design of new molecules employing phenotypic and high-content screening data and assessing their potency, selectivity, and binding affinity\n       \n \n       Use of ML models for predicting bioactivity and ADMET parameters of compounds\n       \n \n \n \n     Ligand discovery for therapeutics development or as clinical research tools (e.g., imaging probes) for novel molecular targets implicated in mental illnesses.\n     \n \n     Biotechnology products and biologics including, but not limited to, large biologic macromolecules, (e.g., proteins, antibodies, and peptides), gene-based therapies (i.e., oligonucleotide- and viral-based), cell therapies, and novel emerging therapies (e.g., microbial and microbiome therapies).\n     \n \n     The inclusion of measures to assess the functional pharmacological activity of the agent is encouraged in dose-finding studies.\n     \n \n     Phase Ib studies in the proposed disease population to confirm target engagement, establish optimal dosing, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD), CNS exposure, functional pharmacological or neurophysiological activity, and tolerability of the novel agent, compound, or device.\n     \n \n     Novel tool and biomarker development to enable studies to assess target engagement, brain PD, and PK for innovative drug targets; for example, PET or SPECT tracers for evaluating receptor occupancy and interrogating dose-response relationships.\n     \n \n     Phase I studies (FIH pharmacology experiments) that include (PD/PK biomarkers to assess target engagement, functional pharmacological activity or neurophysiological effect, safety, and tolerability of new drugs.\n     \n \n     Initial Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) toxicology, safety pharmacology, and pharmacokinetics to support an Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to begin human clinical testing.\n     \n \n     Development and application of novel assays for evaluating brain PD/PK relationships in preclinical and early-phase human studies.\n     \n \n \n    NIMH also encourages applications ranging from early-stage, pre-clinical, device development to FIH clinical trials. Examples include, but are not limited to:\n    \n \n \n     Regulatory activities, including pre-submission meetings with FDA, Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) submission, risk determinations, or other FDA regulatory submissions.\n     \n \n     Modeling technologies capable of precisely characterizing delivered dose of neuromodulation technologies (e.g., electric field modeling) and to accurately measure the impact of the delivered dosage on neural functioning (e.g., simultaneous TMS-EEG, TMS-fMRI or other technologies to demonstrate engagement of the targeted distributed network or neural oscillatory target).\n     \n \n     Linkage of behavior with brain recordings via high-density recordings of both.\n     \n \n     FIH, proof of concept studies that may assess initial measures of safety and efficacy and lead to further refinement of the device.\n     \n \n     Development of packaging, connectors, and other accessories necessary for the translation of this technology.\n     \n \n     Activities to bring the development process under Design and Quality Systems Control.\n     \n \n     Activities to become current Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) compliant.\n     \n \n     GLP compliant large animal model safety and/or testing of an implanted device.\n     \n \n     Bench-top and/or animal testing to demonstrate compliance with FDA Recognized Standards.\n     \n \n     Non-GLP animal studies to develop techniques relevant to the device, optimize relevant therapeutic parameters, and refine device design as necessary for subsequent GLP testing or additional clinical studies for regulatory approval.\n     \n \n     Device, software, and firmware design verification and validation activities.\n     \n \n \n \n     Summary\n     \n \n \n    In summary, the NCDDG Program will support broad, innovative, multidisciplinary approaches to the discovery of new, rationally based treatments and research tools for mental disorders. Since the creative talents in the required scientific disciplines are rarely available in a single institution, a multi-institutional, group approach involving academic, nonprofit, commercial, and/or industrial institutions is envisioned. Academic, pharmaceutical, and biomedical technology scientists are strongly encouraged to form partnerships that take full advantage of their combined intellectual and material resources for drug discovery, lead optimization, model development, and clinical testing. Further, the interaction of academic and non-profit research institutions with the pharmaceutical and biomedical device industry and NIH is expected to facilitate subsequent development and marketing of new pharmacologic and device treatments, although these latter activities are not within the scope of this NOFO. Molecular targets for drug/device discovery, and the sources and types of chemical/circuit entities to be investigated will be selected by the applying group. Both novel mechanisms of action and disease-oriented approaches are of interest.\n    \n \n \n     Research Scope\n     \n \n \n    The objective of this NOFO is to establish NCDDG Groups to conduct innovative, high-impact research focused on the discovery and testing of small molecules or biotechnology products and biologics with potential as candidate therapeutics including, but not limited to, large biologic macromolecules, (e.g., proteins, antibodies, and peptides), gene-based therapies (i.e., oligonucleotide- and viral vector-based), cell therapies, and novel emerging therapies (e.g., microbial and microbiome therapies) \u00a0for novel molecular targets, as well as novel devices for novel circuit/neural dynamic targets implicated in the pathophysiology of mental disorders. The NCDDG serves as a vehicle for pharmaceutical, biomedical devices, and academic scientists to pool intellectual and material resources for the translation of basic science findings into the conceptualization, discovery, and evaluation of new chemical entities and devices. Groups are encouraged to select molecular targets for drug discovery and circuit targets for device discovery based on recent findings in basic and clinical neuroscience, genetics, and proteomics relevant to the understanding of mental disorders.\n    \n \n    The identification of lead compounds/candidate agents/devices and refining them for target validation and medication development are important goals of this initiative.\n    \n \n    It is anticipated that the interaction of academic and non-profit research institutions with NIH and pharmaceutical industry will facilitate timely evaluation and development of preclinical and clinical research tools, models, and novel therapeutics.\n    \n \n    Applicants seeking additional sources of support for preclinical development activities such as toxicology and safety pharmacology assessment, bulk synthesis, GMP synthesis, and formulation development should consider the NIH Blueprint Neurotherapeutics Network program (\n     \n     http://neuroscienceblueprint.nih.gov/bpdrugs/index.htm\n     \n    or\n     \n \n      https://neuroscienceblueprint.nih.gov/neurotherapeutics/bpn-biologics\n      \n \n    ) and/or the\n     \n     NIH Bridging Interventional Development Gaps (BrIDGs) Program\n     \n    .\n    \n \n    Prior to submission of an application, applicants are strongly encouraged to contact the relevant Scientific/Research Contact listed in Section VII of this NOFO to determine if the proposed Research Project would be considered a priority for NIMH.\n    \n \n    Applications with data collection plans that involve multiple respondent groups (e.g., clients/patients, therapists/providers, supervisors, administrators) should consider provisions for human subject protections and consenting procedures for all participant groups, accordingly.\n    \n \n    The NIMH has published updated policies and guidance for investigators regarding human research protection and clinical research data and safety monitoring (\n     \n     NOT-MH-19-027\n     \n    ). The application\u2019s PHS Human Subjects and Clinical Trials Information, including the Data and Safety Monitoring Plan, should reflect the policies and guidance in this notice.

All applications, regardless of the amount of direct costs requested for any one year, must address a Data Management and Sharing Plan.\n     \n \n \n    To advance the goal of advancing research through widespread data sharing among researchers, investigators funded by NIMH under this NOFO are expected to share those data via the\n     \n     National Institute of Mental Health Data Archive\n     \n    (NDA; see\n     \n     NOT-MH-23-100\n     \n    ). Established by the NIH, NDA is a secure informatics platform for scientific collaboration and data-sharing that enables the effective communication of detailed research data, tools, and supporting documentation. NDA links data across research projects through its Global Unique Identifier (GUID) and Data Dictionary technology. Investigators funded under this NOFO are expected to use these technologies to submit data to NDA.\n    \n \n    To accomplish this objective, it will be important to formulate a) an enrollment strategy that will obtain the information necessary to generate a GUID for each participant, and b) a budget strategy that will cover the costs of data submission. The\n     \n     NDA\n     \n    website provides two tools to help investigators develop appropriate strategies: 1)\n     \n     t\n     \n \n     he NDA Data Submission Cost Model\n     \n    which offers a customizable Excel worksheet that includes tasks and hours for the Program Director/Principal Investigator and Data Manager to budget for data sharing; and 2) plain language text to be considered in your informed consent available from the NDA's\n     \n     Data Contribution page\n     \n    . Investigators are expected to certify the quality of all data generated by grants funded under this NOFO prior to submission to NDA and review their data for accuracy after submission. Submission of descriptive/raw data is expected semi-annually (every January 15 and July 15); submission of all other data is expected at the time of publication, or prior to the end of the grant, whichever occurs first (see\n     \n     NDA Sharing Regimen\n     \n    for more information); Investigators are expected to share results, positive and negative, specific to the cohorts and outcome measures studied.For more guidance on submitting data to NDA, refer to the\n     \n     NDA Data Management and Sharing Plan on the NDA website\n     \n    .

As such, these requests will not include any salary and related fringe benefits for career, career conditional or other Federal employees (civilian or uniformed service) with permanent appointments under existing position ceilings or any costs related to administrative or facilities support (equivalent to Facilities and Administrative or F&A costs). These costs may include salary for staff to be specifically hired under a temporary appointment for the project, consultant costs, equipment, supplies, travel, and other items typically listed under Other Expenses. Applicants should indicate the number of person-months devoted to the project, even if no funds are requested for salary and fringe benefits.\n    \n \n    If selected, appropriate funding will be provided by the NIH Intramural Program. NIH intramural scientist will participate in the program as unfunded co-investigators in accordance wth the Terms and Conditions provided in this NOFO. Intellectual property will be managed in accord with established policy of the NIH in compliance with Executive Order 10096, as amended, 45 CFR Part 7; patent rights for inventions developed in NIH facilities are NIH property unless NIH waives its rights.\n    \n \n    Should an extramural application include the collaboration with an intramural scientist, no funds for the support of the intramural scientist may be requested in the application. The intramural scientist may submit a separate request for intramural funding as described above.\n    \n \n \n     Use of Common Data Elements in NIH-funded Research\n     \n \n \n    Many NIH ICs encourage the use of common data elements (CDEs) in basic, clinical, and applied research, patient registries, and other human subject research to facilitate broader and more effective use of data and advance research across studies. CDEs are data elements that have been identified and defined for use in multiple data sets across different studies. Use of CDEs can facilitate data sharing and standardization to improve data quality and enable data integration from multiple studies and sources, including electronic health records. NIH ICs have identified CDEs for many clinical domains (e.g., neurological disease), types of studies (e.g. genome-wide association studies (GWAS)), types of outcomes (e.g., patient-reported outcomes), and patient registries (e.g., the Global Rare Diseases Patient Registry and Data Repository). NIH has established a \u201cCommon Data Element (CDE) Resource Portal\" (\n     \n     http://cde.nih.gov/\n     \n    ) to assist investigators in identifying NIH-supported CDEs when developing protocols, case report forms, and other instruments for data collection. The Portal provides guidance about and access to NIH-supported CDE initiatives and other tools and resources for the appropriate use of CDEs and data standards in NIH-funded research. Investigators are encouraged to consult the Portal and describe in their applications any use they will make of NIH-supported CDEs in their projects.\n    \n \n    NIMH expects investigators for this funding announcement to collect Common Data Elements (CDEs) for mental health human subjects research. Unless NIMH stipulates otherwise during the negotiation of the terms and conditions of a grant award, this Notice applies to all grant applications involving human research participants. The necessary funds for collecting and submitting these CDE data from all research participants to the\n     \n     NIMH Data Archive (NDA)\n     \n    should be included in the requested budget. A cost estimator (\n     \n     https://nda.nih.gov/ndarpublicweb/Documents/NDA_Data_Submission_Costs.xlsx\n     \n    ) is available to facilitate the calculation of these costs. NIMH may seek further information regarding CDEs prior to award. Additional information about CDEs can be found at the\n     \n     NIMH webpage on Data Management and Sharing for Applicants and Awardees.\n     \n \n \n \n \n    6. Funding Restrictions\n    \n \n    All NIH awards are subject to the terms and conditions, cost principles, and other considerations described in the\n     \n     NIH Grants Policy Statement\n     \n    .\n    \n \n    Pre-award costs are allowable only as described in the\n     \n     NIH Grants Policy Statement Section 7.9.1 Selected Items of Cost.\n     \n \n \n \n   7. Other Submission Requirements and Information\n    \n    Applications must be submitted electronically following the instructions described in the How to Apply Application Guide. Paper applications will not be accepted.\n    \n \n    Applicants must complete all required registrations before the application due date. Section III. Eligibility Information contains information about registration.\n    \n \n    For assistance with your electronic application or for more information on the electronic submission process, visit\n     \n     How to Apply \u2013 Application Guide\n     \n    . If you encounter a system issue beyond your control that threatens your ability to complete the submission process on-time, you must follow the\n     \n     Dealing with System Issues\n     \n    guidance. For assistance with application submission, contact the Application Submission Contacts in Section VII.\n    \n \n \n     Important reminders:\n     \n \n \n    All PD(s)/PI(s) must include their eRA Commons ID in the Credential field of the Senior/Key Person Profile form\n     \n     .\n     \n    Failure to register in the Commons and to include a valid PD/PI Commons ID in the credential field will prevent the successful submission of an electronic application to NIH.

Notice of Funding Opportunity Description RFA-MH-26-105: Multimodal Artificial Intelligence to Accelerate HIV Clinical Care (R01 Clinical Trial Optional) Section I. Notice of Funding Opportunity Description\n    \n \n \n \n \n     Background\n     \n \n \n    Novel, data-driven approaches will be necessary to fulfill the Ending the HIV Epidemic in the U.S. (EHE) key strategies to diagnose, prevent, and treat, and respond. The use of transformative technologies in fields such as artificial intelligence (AI) can accelerate scientific discovery, leading to new breakthroughs and innovative strategies for ending the HIV epidemic. Opportunities for using AI in making predictions, real-time monitoring, or to improve decision-making to address HIV prevention, care, and treatment needs abound but have yet to be fully realized. Recent advances in highly flexible, multimodal AI models have generated much interest and discussion about the promise of AI to transform research, clinical care, and public health. This NOFO seeks to leverage these advances by encouraging the use of cutting-edge multimodal AI models to expand our capacity to address the dynamic, complex, and evolving HIV epidemic.\n    \n \n    Multimodal AI is an advanced machine learning model that integrates multiple modalities of data often encountered in clinical practice (e.g., text, images, and audio) to improve predictive accuracy beyond what simpler, unimodal models (i.e., using a single modality of data such as text or images) can achieve. These multimodal models, however, face several technical challenges including quantification of multimodal learning (i.e., quantifying dimension of heterogeneity, identifying interconnections, and optimizing learning processes). While multimodal AI has emerged as a technique that shows great promise in transforming healthcare, current challenges will require the integration of innovations for expanding capabilities to enable greater understanding and the model-based and domain-related explainability of the model outputs.\n    \n \n    Several methods have been developed to enhance model-based explainability such as Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) and Deep Learning Important FeaTures (DeepLIFT) but are limited in domain explainability. One innovation to significantly increase domain interpretability and explainability is through the use of knowledge graphs \u2013 structured data models representing the complex, multi-modal relationships between HIV symptoms, treatments, medications, behaviors, social determinants of health (SDoH), and so forth \u2013 and their dimensions \u2013 providing a more nuanced understanding of HIV which allows for better targeting of prevention efforts, optimizing treatment decisions, and improving patient experience. Furthermore, embedding experimentally testable causality principles into knowledge graphs are essential for further enhancing domain explainability for high stakes uses such as in healthcare.\n    \n \n    To address the evolving complexities in HIV prevention, treatment, and care, integrating advanced technologies such as knowledge graphs \u00a0into multimodal AI models offers a promising new approach. Enhancing the explainability of multimodal AI models with causal knowledge graphs has the potential for more accurate, explainable, and interpretable systems that can be used in a wide range of data-driven applications including comprehensive patient histories, early HIV detection, personalized HIV prevention or treatment plans, remote patient monitoring, real-time patient support, epidemic surveillance, and more to address HIV prevention, treatment, and care needs. Human-centered AI approaches (i.e., designing, developing, and co-creating AI with end-users for a deeper understanding human needs) are also critical for ensuring ethical considerations and stakeholder needs drive the design at all stages of model development: data selection and preparation, model building, training, and assessment, and evaluation and implementation. As such, this initiative provides an opportunity for, multidisciplinary research teams to develop explainable, transparent, and trustworthy human-centered multimodal AI models to improve HIV research, clinical care, and public health.\n    \n \n \n     Research Objectives and Scope\n     \n \n \n    The overarching objective is to support data-driven, technological approaches to accelerate HIV diagnosis, prevention, and treatment efforts, which is closely aligned with the priorities of the NIMH Division of AIDS Research, the NIH Office of AIDS Research, and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. As such, this initiative supports the development of multimodal AI models to expand our capacity to address the dynamic, complex, and evolving HIV epidemic with three primary objectives: (1) development, adaptation, and evaluation of accurate, safe, efficient, and unbiased multimodal AI models to support a diverse range of HIV applications; (2) creation of knowledge graphs to enhance the interpretability and explainability for applications in HIV research, clinical care, and public health; and (3) exploration of synergistic integration of model-based explainability methods, knowledge graphs, and multimodal AI models for more precise model outputs and increased usability in HIV clinical care with a human-centered approach. Cross-disciplinary teams such as end-users, domain experts, patients/clients, community members, bioethicists, data scientists, software developers, engineers, and policymakers are encouraged. Teams are expected to use best practices and meaningful stakeholder engagement to ensure data privacy, security, and consent. Inherent in this initiative is the need for the use of a human-centered AI approach in the design, development, and application to ensure that the system is fair, ethical, and unbiased for a more transformative, meaningful, and sustained impact on HIV clinical care.\n    \n \n \n     Development, Adaptation, and Evaluation of Accurate, Safe, Efficient and Unbiased Multimodal AI Models for HIV\n     \n \n \n    Applicants are expected to propose innovative projects focused on the development, adaptation, and evaluation of multimodal AI models that can support a wide range of data-driven applications. These applications may include but are not limited to early HIV detection, personalized HIV prevention or treatment plans, and real-time patient support, epidemic monitoring and surveillance, and clinical trials research with the final\u00a0model demonstrating the potential for a significant impact for the specified HIV-related application. Multimodal AI models must integrate at least\u00a0two different modalities of data (e.g., text, audio, images, videos) and draw from at least two data sources (e.g., medical records, claims data, pharmacy records, wearable devices, patient surveys to identify SDoH needs). Applications should describe the entire model development process, including training and architectural design (e.g., data modalities and sources, representation learning, methods for model fusion), as well as how stakeholder perspectives will be integrated, and potential challenges (e.g., handling missing or unbalanced data, managing data dimensionality). Considerations regarding equity and biases must also be included to ensure fair and unbiased model performance. In addition, applicants may consider adapting an existing multimodal AI model when appropriate for the specific HIV application and context. This can be achieved by connecting existing models through the use of application programming interfaces (APIs), enabling new functionalities (e.g., to improve model reasoning capabilities).\n    \n \n \n     Creation of Knowledge Graphs to Enhance Interpretability and Explainability for\n     \n \n     Application in HIV Research, Clinical Care, and Public Health\n     \n \n \n    Combining multiple modalities increases model complexity and challenges the interpretability and explainability of multimodal AI models, making it difficult for users to understand\n     \n     how\n     \n    or\n     \n     why\n     \n    a model, for example, predicted a cluster of HIV cases or recommended a specific HIV treatment regimen. A promising novel solution to this issue is the integration of domain-specific knowledge using knowledge graphs. Knowledge graphs are designed to integrate complex, diverse data to capture\n     \n     nodes\n     \n    (representing real-world entities such as HIV symptoms, biomarkers, treatments, behaviors, SDoH)\u00a0and\n     \n     edges\n     \n    (representing different relationships between nodes such as symptoms-treatment) in a structured manner. Generating a domain-specific knowledge graph, however, is challenging due to the heterogeneity of health data and the need to ensure that the knowledge graph represents the complex causal relationships and is context-specific, dynamic, and evolving.\n    Applications should describe the process for developing the domain-specific knowledge graph to represent HIV knowledge relevant to the specific HIV application. Research teams may propose to develop or adapt an existing HIV-specific knowledge graph, but must address\n     \n     how\n     \n    they plan to assess, maintain, update, and expand the knowledge graph through automated or other means.\n    \n \n \n     Exploring the Synergistic Integration of Knowledge Graphs and Multimodal AI Models for More Precise Model Outputs and Increased Usability in HIV Diagnosis, Prevention, and Treatment\n     \n \n \n    Frameworks for integrating domain-specific knowledge graphs into large language models (LLMs) have been proposed to enhance model performance and interpretability on a number of tasks (e.g., enhanced understanding and interpretation, encoding data, knowledge representation and reasoning). Novel methods using synergistic approaches that allow for bidirectional reasoning between a LLM and knowledge graph is a new and exciting area that can lead to diverse applications in multimodal AI reasoning capabilities. Applicants are expected to explore the synergistic integration of the multimodal AI model with an HIV-specific knowledge graph for enhancing knowledge representation or reasoning.\n    \n \n \n     Use of Best Practices in the Design, Development, and Use of AI Models\n     \n \n \n    In collaboration with community and implementing partners, several technical, ethical, and regulatory considerations are expected to be addressed in the application in order to\n     \n \n    build user trust\n     \n \n    in the multimodal AI model. These include, but are not limited to, using secure approaches designed to protect data privacy, training models using balanced data, identifying and mitigating model biases, adhering to relevant data privacy regulations, monitoring data security and compliance with regulations, maintaining detailed documentation to enhance model transparency and accountability, such as by using model cards to describe the model, features, and intended use, and establishing a data governance framework for managing and protected the data including model use limitations. Research teams are also expected to develop clear consent documentation and procedures with their community and implementing partners that will enable transparent, clear, and open communication with users. Additional considerations when designing, developing, and using automated systems that have the potential to meaningfully impact access to critical resources or services such as healthcare are identified in the\n     \n     Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights\n     \n    put forward by the U.S. Office of Science and Technology Policy.

As such, a resource sharing plan is required for this NOFO. Applicants must describe their plan for open dissemination of protocols, methods, models, software, and/or code, findings and related tools to the community such that they are readily usable and extensible, where applicable. The multimodal AI model, as well as the processes for developing and preparing the model (e.g., data curation, model training, model assessment), must be documented using appropriate methods (e.g., model card) to enhance transparency, accountability, and reproducibility.\n    \n \n \n \n \n     Other Plan(s):\n     \n \n \n    All instructions in the How to Apply-Application Guide must be followed, with the following additional instructions:\n    \n \n \n \n    All applicants planning research (funded or conducted in whole or in part by NIH) that results in the generation of scientific data are required to comply with the instructions for the Data Management and Sharing Plan. All applications, regardless of the amount of direct costs requested for any one year, must address a Data Management and Sharing Plan.\n    \n \n    To advance the goal of advancing research through widespread data sharing among researchers, investigators funded under this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) are expected to share those data via the\n     \n \n      National Institute of Mental Health Data Archive\n      \n \n    (NDA; see\n     \n \n      NOT-MH-23-100\n      \n \n    ). Established by the NIH, NDA is a secure informatics platform for scientific collaboration and data-sharing that enables the effective communication of detailed research data, tools, and supporting documentation. NDA links data across research projects through its Global Unique Identifier (GUID) and Data Dictionary technology. Investigators funded under this NOFO are expected to use these technologies to submit data to NDA.\n    \n \n    To accomplish this objective, it will be important to formulate a) an enrollment strategy that will obtain the information necessary to generate a GUID for each participant, and b) a budget strategy that will cover the costs of data submission. The NDA website provides two tools to help investigators develop appropriate strategies: 1)\n     \n \n      the NDA Data Submission Cost Model\n      \n \n    which offers a customizable Excel worksheet that includes tasks and hours for the Program Director/Principal Investigator and Data Manager to budget for data sharing; and 2) plain language text to be considered in your informed consent available from the NDA's\n     \n \n      Data Contribution page\n      \n \n    . Investigators are expected to certify the quality of all data generated by grants funded under this NOFO prior to submission to NDA and review their data for accuracy after submission. Submission of descriptive/raw data is expected semi-annually (every January 15 and July 15); submission of all other data is expected at the time of publication, or prior to the end of the grant, whichever occurs first (see\n     \n \n      NDA Sharing Regimen\n      \n \n    for more information); Investigators are expected to share results, positive and negative, specific to the cohorts and outcome measures studied. For more guidance on submitting data to NDA, refer to the\n     \n \n      NDA Data Management and Sharing Plan on the NDA website\n      \n \n    . \u202f NDA staff will work with investigators to help them submit data types not yet defined in the\n     \n \n      NDA Data Dictionary\n      \n \n    .\n    \n \n \n \n      Specific to this RFA.\n      \n \n    All data from the awarded studies are expected to be shared (or linked) using the NIMH Data Archives (NDA) consistent with the NIMH Data Management and Sharing Policy (NOT-MH-23-100).\n    \n \n \n \n \n     Appendix:\n     \n    Only limited Appendix materials are allowed.

Submission Dates and Times\n    \n \n    Part I.\u00a0contains information about Key Dates and times. Applicants are encouraged to submit applications before the due date to ensure they have time to make any application corrections that might be necessary for successful submission. When a submission date falls on a weekend or\n     \n     Federal holiday\n     \n    , the application deadline is automatically extended to the next business day.\n    \n \n    Organizations must submit applications to\n     \n     Grants.gov\n     \n    (the online portal to find and apply for grants across all Federal agencies). Applicants must then complete the submission process by tracking the status of the application in the\n     \n     eRA Commons\n     \n    , NIH\u2019s electronic system for grants administration. NIH and Grants.gov systems check the application against many of the application instructions upon submission. Errors must be corrected and a changed/corrected application must be submitted to Grants.gov on or before the application due date and time. \u00a0If a Changed/Corrected application is submitted after the deadline, the application will be considered late. Applications that miss the due date and time are subjected to the\n     \n     NIH Grants Policy Statement Section 2.3.9.2 Electronically Submitted Applications\n     \n    .\n    \n \n \n     Applicants are responsible for viewing their application before the due date in the eRA Commons to ensure accurate and successful submission.\n     \n \n \n    Information on the submission process and a definition of on-time submission are provided in the How to Apply-Application Guide.\n    \n \n \n \n    5. Intergovernmental Review (E.O. 12372)\n    \n \n    This initiative is not subject to\n     \n     intergovernmental review.\n     \n \n \n \n \n \n     Use of Common Data Elements in NIH-funded Research\n     \n \n \n    Many NIH ICs encourage the use of common data elements (CDEs) in basic, clinical, and applied research, patient registries, and other human subject research to facilitate broader and more effective use of data and advance research across studies. CDEs are data elements that have been identified and defined for use in multiple data sets across different studies. Use of CDEs can facilitate data sharing and standardization to improve data quality and enable data integration from multiple studies and sources, including electronic health records. NIH ICs have identified CDEs for many clinical domains (e.g., neurological disease), types of studies (e.g. genome-wide association studies (GWAS)), types of outcomes (e.g., patient-reported outcomes), and patient registries (e.g., the Global Rare Diseases Patient Registry and Data Repository). NIH has established a \u201cCommon Data Element (CDE) Resource Portal\" (\n     \n \n      http://cde.nih.gov/\n      \n \n    ) to assist investigators in identifying NIH-supported CDEs when developing protocols, case report forms, and other instruments for data collection. The Portal provides guidance about and access to NIH-supported CDE initiatives and other tools and resources for the appropriate use of CDEs and data standards in NIH-funded research. Investigators are encouraged to consult the Portal and describe in their applications any use they will make of NIH-supported CDEs in their projects.\n    \n \n    NIMH expects investigators for this funding announcement to collect Common Data Elements (CDEs) for HIV-related human subjects research funded by NIMH (\n     \n     NOT-MH-23-105\n     \n    ). Unless NIMH stipulates otherwise during the negotiation of the terms and conditions of a grant award, this Notice applies to all grant applications involving human research participants. The necessary funds for collecting and submitting these CDEs from all research participants to the\n     \n     NIMH Data Archive (NDA)\n     \n    should be included in the requested budget. A cost estimator\n     \n     (https://nda.nih.gov/ndarpublicweb/Documents/NDA_Data_Submission_Costs.xlsx\n     \n    ) is available to facilitate the calculation of these costs. NIMH may seek further information regarding CDEs prior to award. Details for HIV-funded NIMH research can be found at\n     \n     NOT-MH-23-105\n     \n    and the\n     \n     NIMH webpage on Data Management and Sharing for Applicants and Awardees\n     \n    . The NIMH CDEs for HIV-funded research should be briefly described in the Data Management and Sharing Plan.\n    \n \n \n \n    6.

Administrative and National Policy Requirements\n    \n \n    The following Federal wide and HHS-specific policy requirements apply to awards funded through NIH:\n    \n \n \n     The rules listed at\n      \n      2 CFR Part 200\n      \n     , Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards.\n     \n \n     All NIH grant and cooperative agreement awards include the\n      \n      NIH Grants Policy Statement\n      \n     as part of the terms and conditions in the Notice of Award (NoA). The NoA includes the requirements of this NOFO. For these terms of award, see the\n      \n      NIH Grants Policy Statement Part II: Terms and Conditions of NIH Grant Awards, Subpart A: General\n      \n     and\n      \n      Part II: Terms and Conditions of NIH Grant Awards, Subpart B: Terms and Conditions for Specific Types of Grants, Recipients, and Activities\n      \n     .\n     \n \n     If a recipient receives an award, the recipient must follow all applicable nondiscrimination laws. The recipient agrees to this when registering in SAM.gov. The recipient must also submit an Assurance of Compliance (\n      \n      HHS-690\n      \n     ). To learn more, see the\n      \n      Laws and Regulations Enforced by the\u00a0HHS Office for Civil Rights website\n      \n     .\n      \n \n       HHS recognizes that NIH research projects are often limited in scope for many reasons that are nondiscriminatory, such as the principal investigator\u2019s scientific interest, funding limitations, recruitment requirements, and other considerations. Thus, criteria in research protocols that target or exclude certain populations are warranted where nondiscriminatory justifications establish that such criteria are appropriate with respect to the health or safety of the subjects, the scientific study design, or the purpose of the research.

Proposed studies are expected to improve understanding, diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of the diseases being studied, and should focus on research questions likely to have high clinical impact.\n    \n \n    Examples of observational studies that would be appropriate for this NOFO if they are high risk include:\n    \n \n \n     Studies to provide incidence and/or prevalence data for a disease\n     \n \n     Studies to describe the natural history or clinical course of disease\n     \n \n     Studies to establish risk factors at the individual or population level for disease development or progression\n     \n \n     Studies to assess the performance of a novel diagnostic\n     \n \n \n    For the purpose of this NOFO, a clinical research center may encompass one or more physical locations where the clinical study is being conducted -- i.e., where study participants are recruited, and/or are intervened upon and/or have outcomes assessed under a single protocol \u2013 as long as all locations are under the overall direction of a single investigator. A data coordinating center is not considered a clinical research center.\n    \n \n \n     Definition of Risk\n     \n \n \n    As explained in\n     \n     NOT-DK-20-051\n     \n    , the risk level of a clinical trial or an observational study may be related to interventional and/or operational risk. The examples below provide general guidelines for risk assessment and are not exhaustive.\n     \n     Potential applicants are strongly encouraged to contact NIDDK staff\n     \n    to discuss their proposed study and determine the most appropriate mechanism for submitting their application.\n    \n \n    Examples of high-risk study designs include:\n    \n \n \n     An intervention that has an unknown safety profile or has substantial side effects (including all studies requiring an IND/IDE application). This would include studies of a drug in a new population, or study of a licensed product for an unapproved indication;\n     \n \n     A complex or invasive intervention, including diagnostic procedures;\n     \n \n     A study involving complex assessment of multiple outcomes, including the ascertainment of outcomes using invasive research procedures;\n     \n \n     Pragmatic trials proposing significant changes to standard of care practices, or significant coordination with multiple care providers and healthcare data systems;\n     \n \n     A multi-center study involving more than minimal risk in vulnerable study populations (as defined in 45 CFR 46)\n     \n \n \n    Studies that do not meet the above criteria will generally be considered to involve low-risk interventions. Low-risk multi-center studies usually include the administration/use of a licensed product for an approved indication, or the provision of a routine intervention that could be used in the setting in which it is being studied (e.g., a lifestyle intervention to promote weight loss).\n    \n \n    Examples of multi-center studies with high operational risk include:\n    \n \n \n     An inexperienced investigator, defined by lack of experience in conducting clinical trials, coordinating research across multiple centers, or recruiting the population to be studied;\n     \n \n     A complex study design that involves standardization of research measures and outcomes collection and research data capture over multiple centers;\n     \n \n     A study that involves the establishment of agreements with third parties that intend to utilize research study data to support regulatory filings with the FDA\n     \n \n \n    Multi-center studies that do not meet the above criteria will generally be considered to have low operational risk.\n    \n \n    A multi-center study is classified as \u201chigh risk\u201d if it utilizes either a high-risk intervention or has high operational risk, or both.\n    \n \n \n     Applications for low-risk multi-center clinical studies will not be accepted\n     \n    under this NOFO and may be submitted to\n     \n     PA-20-185\n     \n    or other appropriate NIH NOFOs.\n    \n \n \n     This NOFO will not accept applications for clinical trials.\n     \n \n \n \n     Overview of the NIDDK process for support of investigator-initiated, multi-center clinical studies:\n     \n \n \n    NIDDK supports investigator-initiated, high-risk multi-center clinical observational studies through a two-part process: 1) implementation planning phase followed by 2) multi-center clinical study cooperative agreement (U01).\n     \n     PAR-25-090\n     \n    NIDDK Multi-Center Clinical Study Implementation Planning Cooperative Agreements (U34) provides support for the planning phase; this NOFO addresses the funding for the clinical study.\n    \n \n    Part 1. Implementation Planning Phase\n    \n \n    NIDDK will support clinical study planning (U34) cooperative agreements for high-risk multi-center clinical studies. The U34 is intended to support all administrative study group activities that are required in order to begin recruitment of participants. These activities include, but are not limited to: establishing the research team, developing tools for data management and oversight of the research, defining recruitment strategies, finalizing the protocol and investigators brochure, writing of the Manual of Operations, establishing a data and safety monitoring plan, and initiating the IRB approval process.\n    \n \n    It is expected that receipt of a U34 will lead to the timely submission of an application (U01) for support of the full-scale study, incorporating the elements developed during the planning period. The goal of the planning phase is to ensure that the clinical study will be able to begin recruitment almost immediately, should a U01 be awarded.\n    \n \n    Prospective applicants should note that funding of a U34 does not guarantee or imply funding for a subsequent U01 application.\n    \n \n    Part 2. Multi-Center Clinical Study Cooperative Agreement (U01).\n    \n \n    The U01 will support the conduct of the clinical study.\n    \n \n    Planning activities are not permitted as part of the U01 application. It is expected that planning work done during the U34 phase, or through some alternative funding mechanism, will allow the U01 applicant to initiate study staff training followed by study participant recruitment as soon as the U01 award is made. Applicants who feel they have completed all the planning elements without a U34 may apply directly for the U01. Further information regarding the U34/U01 process supported by these companion NOFOs, including a set of frequently asked questions (FAQs) can be found at:\n     \n \n      https://www.niddk.nih.gov/research-funding/human-subjects-research\n      \n \n    .\n    \n \n    Applications should include only one clinical study.\n    \n \n    Many of the diseases or conditions within the mission of NIDDK disproportionately affect individuals from minoritized and underserved communities. NIDDK encourages research focusing on such populations, including individuals from racial and ethnic minority groups, rural populations, sexual and gender minority groups and other socioeconomically disadvantaged and medically underserved communities. NIDDK places a high priority on clinical studies to understand and eliminate health disparities and promote health equity.\n    \n \n    NIDDK is committed to conducting clinical studies that have been developed in partnership with patients, community members, families, healthcare providers, organizations, and other relevant partners who are affected by or have a direct interest in the research\n    (\n     \n     Pathways to Health for All: Health Disparities & Health Equity Research Recommendations & Opportunities - NIDDK (nih.gov)\n     \n    ). Active and meaningful engagement should involve these individuals and/or organizations in the development, design, and execution of the study\n    , as well as in dissemination of findings.\n    Meaningful engagement must entail more than focus groups, surveys or other activities where people are only involved as participants or respondents. Rather, engagement approaches must involve bidirectional\n    and sustained communication and interactions that result in informed decision-making about high-priority research needs and issues that are important to\n    affected individuals, community members, and/or organizations, especially populations who disproportionately experience NIDDK mission diseases.\n    Engagement activities that bring to bear the expertise and lived experience of affected individuals and diverse communities may yield interventional, recruitment and retention approaches that are more likely to be acceptable and effective, and less likely to cause harm. Engagement that involves trust building and repairing when needed, and use of culturally appropriate research approaches (i.e., identifying the health problem, design, and materials) is an important method to enhance and assess research outcomes including recruitment and retention goals, specific health outcomes, and sustainability of efficacious interventions. Ideally, affected individuals, groups, and organizations are not only \u201cengaged,\u201d but integrated equitably into the research team which includes appropriate orientation and onboarding support to the team, and compensation.\n    \n \n    Since the complete study design and protocol must be included in the U01 application, it is expected that investigators can demonstrate substantial engagement and partnership with appropriate individuals, community members, and or organizations prior to the U01 submission.\n    \n \n \n     This NOFO will only support research within the mission of NIDDK.\n     \n    Research applications in areas that are primarily within the missions of other NIH Institutes and Centers are not appropriate for this NOFO and will not be supported. NIDDK has many diseases within its\n     \n \n      mission\n      \n \n    , but all research related to relevant diseases may not be appropriate for NIDDK.\n     \n     Applicants to this NOFO are strongly encouraged to contact NIDDK staff as soon as possible in the development of the application and generally at least 12 weeks prior to the application date\n     \n    . NIDDK staff can help the applicant understand whether the proposed clinical study is within the goals and mission of the Institute and is appropriate for this NOFO. As part of the consultation process, NIDDK staff will consider whether the proposed clinical study meets the goals and mission of the Institute, whether it addresses one or more high priority research areas and meets programmatic needs, including balance across research areas, whether it is appropriate to conduct as an investigator-initiated clinical study, and whether appropriate funds might be available for the clinical study. During the consultation phase, if the proposed study does not meet NIDDK's programmatic needs or is not appropriate as an investigator-initiated clinical study, applicants will be strongly encouraged to consider other Funding Opportunities. If NIDDK ascertains that substantial additional preliminary data or planning may be necessary, the applicant will be encouraged to consider applying for funding under the appropriate NOFO.

CDEs are data elements that have been identified and defined for use in multiple data sets across different studies. Use of CDEs can facilitate data sharing and standardization to improve data quality and enable data integration from multiple studies and sources, including electronic health records. NIH ICs have identified CDEs for many clinical domains (e.g., neurological disease), types of studies (e.g. genome-wide association studies (GWAS)), types of outcomes (e.g., patient-reported outcomes), and patient registries (e.g., the Global Rare Diseases Patient Registry and Data Repository). NIH has established a \u201cCommon Data Element (CDE) Resource Portal\" (\n     \n     http://cde.nih.gov/\n     \n    ) to assist investigators in identifying NIH-supported CDEs when developing protocols, case report forms, and other instruments for data collection. The Portal provides guidance about and access to NIH-supported CDE initiatives and other tools and resources for the appropriate use of CDEs and data standards in NIH-funded research. Investigators are encouraged to consult the Portal and describe in their applications any use they will make of NIH-supported CDEs in their projects.\n    \n \n \n \n    Requests of $500,000 or more for direct costs in any year\n    \n \n    Applicants requesting $500,000 or more in direct costs in any year (excluding consortium F&A) must contact a Scientific/ Research Contact at least 6 weeks before submitting the application and follow the Policy on the Acceptance for Review of Unsolicited Applications that Request $500,000 or More in Direct Costs as described in the SF424 (R&R) Application Guide.\n    \n \n \n   Mandatory Disclosure\n    \n    Recipients or subrecipients must submit any information related to violations of federal criminal law involving fraud, bribery, or gratuity violations potentially affecting the federal award.

The administrative and funding instrument used for this program will be the cooperative agreement, an \"assistance\" mechanism (rather than an \"acquisition\" mechanism), in which substantial NIH programmatic involvement with the recipients is anticipated during the performance of the activities. Under the cooperative agreement, the NIH purpose is to support and stimulate the recipients' activities by involvement in and otherwise working jointly with the award recipients in a partnership role; it is not to assume direction, prime responsibility, or a dominant role in the activities. Consistent with this concept, the dominant role and prime responsibility resides with the recipients for the project as a whole, although specific tasks and activities may be shared among the recipients and the NIH as defined below.\n    \n \n \n     The Program Director(s)/Principal Investigator(s) will have the primary responsibility for:\n     \n \n \n    1. Developing the research design and study protocol, including definition of objectives and approaches, sample size and power calculations, and establishing procedures for participant recruitment and follow-up, data collection, quality control, interim data and safety monitoring, final data analysis and interpretation, and publication of results.\n    \n \n    2. Establishing a Steering Committee to implement, coordinate and manage the project(s). Recipient(s) will name investigators to serve as members on a Steering Committee and other subcommittees, as appropriate, meeting periodically. Recipients will be required to accept and implement the common protocol(s) and procedures approved by the Steering Committee.\n    \n \n    3. Designating Protocol Chairs. The Program Directors/Principal Investigators (for studies involving multiple protocols) shall designate a single Protocol Chairperson (if the Program Director/Principal Investigator does not assume this role) for each protocol to be carried out by the study group. The Protocol Chairperson shall function as the scientific coordinator for the protocol and shall assume responsibility for obtaining approval to implement the protocol from the Steering Committee and for developing and monitoring the protocol. Significant modifications to approved protocols must be approved by the Steering Committee.\n    \n \n    4. Implementing collection of data specified by the study protocol. For a multi-center study, each recipient/site is required to ensure that data will be submitted expeditiously to the Data Coordinating Center. Additionally, individual investigators/sites must demonstrate the ability to implement the strategy specifically designed for their individual study population.\n    \n \n    5. Establishing procedures for data quality, completeness, and security. Recipients are responsible for ensuring accurate and timely assessment of the progress of each study, including development of procedures to ensure that data collection and management are: (1) adequate for quality control and analysis; (2) for clinical trials, as simple as appropriate in order to facilitate cooperation/referral of study participants by physicians to avoid unnecessary expense; and (3) sufficiently staffed across the participating institutions. For research involving multiple sites, a plan for analysis of pooled data will be developed by the Steering Committee.\n    \n \n    6. Submitting interim progress reports, when requested or agreed upon by both parties, to the NIDDK Program Official including as a minimum, summary data on protocol performance. For coordinated multiple awards or a multi-site single award, the NIDDK Program Official may require additional information from individual clinical sites. Such reports are in addition to the required annual noncompeting continuation progress report.\n    \n \n    7. Reporting of the study findings. Recipients will retain custody of and have primary rights to the data and software developed under these awards, subject to Government rights of access consistent with current DHHS, PHS, and NIH policies. The recipient must also be adherent to Study Publication and Presentation Policy. The NIDDK will have access to and may periodically review all data generated under an award. NIDDK staff may co-author publications of findings with recipients consistent with NIH policies and network/consortium policies.\n    \n \n    8. Any third-party collaboration (including but not limited to interactions with organizations from industry, academia, and nonprofit institutions) should be governed by a research collaboration agreement (e.g., Clinical Trial Agreement, Research Collaborative Agreement, etc.) or any third-party contract mechanism(s) with terms that ensure the collaboration is conducted in accordance with the Cooperative Agreement, applicable NIH/NIDDK policies and procedures, and network/consortium policies, and with written approval from NIDDK Program staff. Any relevant proposed third-party agreements related to the network/consortium studies between grantee and third-party will be provided to the NIDDK Program staff and NIDDK Technology Advancement Office for review, comment, and approval to assure compliance with NIH/NIDDK policies and network/consortium policies. Further, at the request of the NIDDK Program staff, any other network/consortium-relevant third-party agreements must be shared with NIDDK. Failure to comply with this term may prompt action in accordance with NIH Grants Policy Statement, Section 8.5 titled: \u201cSpecial Award Conditions and Remedies for Noncompliance (Special Award Conditions and Enforcement Actions)\u201d, and Section 8.5.2, titled: \u201cRemedies for Noncompliance or Enforcement Actions: Suspension, Termination, and Withholding Support\u201d, noncompliance with the terms and conditions of award will be considered by the funding IC for future funding and support decisions and may result in termination of the award.\u201d\n    \n \n    9. Any involvement of a third-party (including but not limited to industry, academia, and nonprofit institutions) in the study and network/consortium activities that includes access to any network/consortium generated resources (i.e., data and bio-samples), or study results that are not publicly available, or using the name of the network/consortium or study or the name of the NIH or NIDDK, is permitted only after written permission by the NIDDK Program staff who will consult with others at NIH and NIDDK Technology Advancement Office.\n    \n \n    10. Maintaining confidentiality of information: The recipient(s) will maintain the confidentiality of the information developed by the investigators (i.e., protocols, data analysis, conclusions, etc.) as well as proprietary information of an individual company or other entity collaborating with the study or network/consortium. Any exception requires written approval from NIDDK Program staff.\n    \n \n    11.\u00a0Data Management and Sharing Plan: In accordance with the NIH Policy for Data Management and Sharing (\n     \n     NIH NOT-OD-21-013\n     \n    ), the NIDDK approved plan will become a term and condition of award, be routinely monitored during the award period, and compliance may factor into future funding decisions. By the end of the funding or proprietary period, a recipient or study group may not continue to exclusively use or share study generated resources until those resources are available to the public via a NIDDK approved repository per the NIDDK approved plan. The NIDDK has established a Central Repository to support the receipt, storage, and distribution of data, bio-samples, and other resources generated in clinical studies funded by the NIH/NIDDK. When the NIDDK Central Repository is to be utilized, prior to enrolling participants, the PI or his/her designee will coordinate with the NIDDK Program and Central Repository staff to prepare for eventual archiving and distribution of the study generated resources that are to be maintained in the Central Repository. These resources will be available to the wider scientific community in accordance with the NIH Data Management and Sharing policy (\n     \n     http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/data_sharing/\n     \n    and,\n     \n     https://grants.nih.gov/policy/sharing.htm\n     \n    , and\n     \n     http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/data_sharing/data_sharing_faqs.htm\n     \n    ), per the NIDDK approved data management and sharing plan.\n    \n \n    12. Study investigators are required to publish and to release publicly and disseminate results and other products of the study, in accordance with study protocols, Steering Committee policies on publications, and the NIDDK approved Data Management and Sharing Plan.\n    \n \n    13.

The final structure of the Steering Committee and voting procedures will be established at the first meeting. The NIDDK Project Scientist or Project Coordinator will have voting membership on the Steering Committee, and as appropriate, its subcommittees. The frequency of Steering Committee meetings will be dictated by a vote of the members of the Steering Committee. The NIDDK Program Official may serve as a non-voting member on the Steering Committee.\n    \n \n    A Chairperson of the Steering Committee will be selected and voted on by the Steering Committee members. The Chairperson provides leadership to the Committee by conducting the Steering Committee meetings and by interacting closely with the recipients during protocol development and implementation. The NIDDK Project Scientist or Project Coordinator may not serve as Chairperson. The NIDDK Program Official will review the Committee\u2019s selection for potential bias, conflicts of interest, or lack of required expertise. If the Program Official has concerns regarding selection of the Chairperson which are not satisfactorily resolved, the Program Official may withhold concurrence if approved by the Director, Division of Extramural Activities, NIDDK based on written justification. In cases where Program Official concurrence is withheld, the Steering Committee will be required to make another selection.\n    \n \n \n     External Consultants\n     \n \n \n    An independent panel of External Consultants may be established by the Steering Committee. The External Consultants may periodically review interim progress of the project(s) and provide reports to the Steering Committee. Members of the panel of External Consultants may be asked, on an ad hoc basis, to participate in the peer review of applications for new research initiatives that utilize special \u201copportunity pool\u201d funds. The NIDDK Program Official will review the Committee\u2019s selections for potential bias, conflicts of interest, or lack of required expertise. If the NIDDK Program Official has concerns regarding selection of one or more External Consultants which are not satisfactorily resolved, the NIDDK Program Official may withhold concurrence if approved by the Director of NIDDK Division of Extramural Activities based on written justification. In cases where NIDDK Program Official concurrence is withheld, the Steering Committee will be required to make another selection.\n    \n \n \n     Dispute Resolution\n     \n \n \n    Any disagreement that may arise on scientific/programmatic matters (within the scope of the award), between award recipients and the NIDDK may be brought to dispute resolution. A dispute resolution panel will be composed of three members --one selected by the recipient (or the Steering Committee, with the NIDDK member not voting), a second member selected by NIDDK, and the third member elected by the two prior selected members. These special dispute resolution procedures in no way affect the recipient's right to appeal an adverse action that is otherwise appealable in accordance with PHS regulations at 42 CFR Part 50, Subpart D, and DHHS regulations at 45 CFR Part 16.\n    \n \n \n   3. Data Management and Sharing\n    \n    Consistent with the 2023 NIH Policy for Data Management and Sharing, when data management and sharing is applicable to the award, recipients will be required to adhere to the Data Management and Sharing requirements as outlined in the\n     \n     NIH Grants Policy Statement\n     \n    . Upon the approval of a Data Management and Sharing Plan, it is required for recipients to implement the plan as described.\n    \n \n \n \n    4.

Notice of Funding Opportunity Description\n    \n \n \n \n \n     PURPOSE\n     \n \n \n    The purpose of this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) is to stimulate HIV/AIDS research within the scientific mission areas of the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communications Disorders (NIDCD). Applications should address high priority HIV/AIDS research outlined by the NIH Office of AIDS Research (OAR) [\n     \n     https://www.oar.nih.gov/hiv-policy-and-research/research-priorities\n     \n    ] in the areas of hearing, balance, taste, smell, voice, speech, and language. This NOFO seeks to expand research efforts in communication disorders as they impact people living with HIV (PLWH). Communication disorders not only compromise physical health, but also affect the emotional, social, recreational, educational, and vocational aspects of life. The effects often ripple outward to affect families and social networks, including those at work and school. The impact of these disorders with regards to quality of life and unfulfilled potential is substantial.\n    \n \n \n     OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE\n     \n \n \n    The objective of this NOFO is to advance HIV research addressing NIDCD\u2019s mission areas to inform treatment and prevention strategies to improve the health of PLWH across the lifespan. This NOFO will support hypothesis-driven epidemiological, basic, translational, and clinical research. Multidisciplinary collaborations between investigators in the fields of communication disorders and HIV/AIDS research as well as the leveraging of current HIV/AIDS cohorts and clinical trials are encouraged.

Criteria\n    \n \n    Only the review criteria described below will be considered in the review process. Applications submitted to the NIH in support of the\n     \n     NIH mission\n     \n    are evaluated for scientific and technical merit through the NIH peer review system.\n    \n \n \n \n    For this particular announcement, note the following:\n    \n \n    The R21 exploratory/developmental grant supports investigation of novel scientific ideas or new model systems, tools, or technologies that have the potential for significant impact on biomedical or biobehavioral research. An R21 grant application need not have extensive background material or preliminary information. Accordingly, reviewers will emphasize the conceptual framework, the level of innovation, and the potential to significantly advance our knowledge or understanding. Appropriate justification for the proposed work can be provided through literature citations, data from other sources, or, when available, from investigator-generated data. Preliminary data are not required for R21 applications; however, they may be included if available.\n    \n \n    A proposed Clinical Trial application may include study design, methods, and intervention that are not by themselves innovative but address important questions or unmet needs. Additionally, the results of the clinical trial may indicate that further clinical development of the intervention is unwarranted or lead to new avenues of scientific investigation.\n    \n \n \n   Overall Impact\n    \n    Reviewers will provide an overall impact score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood for the project to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the research field(s) involved, in consideration of the following scored review criteria and additional review criteria (as applicable for the project proposed). An application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged likely to have a major scientific impact.\n    \n \n \n   Scored Review Criteria\n    \n    Reviewers will consider Factors 1, 2 and 3 in the determination of scientific merit, and in providing an overall impact score.

Notice of Funding Opportunity Description Expired PAR-25-363: NEI Translational Research Program for Therapeutics (R33 Clinical Trial Not Allowed) Section I. Notice of Funding Opportunity Description\n    \n \n \n \n \n     Research Objectives\n     \n \n \n    The mission of the National Eye Institute (NEI) is to eliminate vision loss and improve quality of life through vision research. The NEI invites applications for research that aligns with our\n     \n     strategic plan.\n     \n    The purpose of this program is to accelerate the development of biological, pharmacological, medical device, and/or combination product interventions for clinicians to use in the treatment of visual system diseases and disorders. \u00a0In the context of this program, the PD/PI assembles a multi-disciplinary research team that employs an integrative approach to the rapid and efficient translation of laboratory research findings into IND or IDE applications to the FDA for testing new therapeutic approaches. The collaborative teams must include as appropriate, non-clinical and clinical scientists, disease experts, regulatory experts, bioethics specialists, experts in manufacturing under Quality Systems and Design Controls, and other relevant academic, clinical, and/or industry experts.\n    \n \n    This program is not intended to support solely basic science, platform technologies or isolated technology development. The goal is to produce preclinical data that will support an IND or IDE application to the FDA. Each project must have a well-defined end point, of developing a new device or treatment for a specific ocular disease that is achievable within a three-year time frame. The steps towards this goal should be clearly delineated in a series of milestones that support the development of a therapeutic or device that can be tested in a clinical trial.\n    \n \n    Structure\n    \n \n    This NOFO will utilize a milestone-driven R33 mechanism. Applicants are strongly encouraged to use project management principles to help facilitate achievement of performance milestones as appropriate.\n    \n \n    The R33 phase can be up to three years and will support research that is in the final states of preclinical development with potential for near-term clinical development. The R33 is to focus on advancing a single therapeutic candidate through IND/IDE -enabling studies, filing an IND/IDE package with the FDA, and designing future clinical trials. \u00a0R33 recipients must submit or obtain an Investigational New Drug/Investigational Device Exemption (IND/IDE) application to FDA, or must transition the product to clinical practice, within the period of performance. \u00a0The specific activities appropriate for the R33 phase will depend on the product under study and available preliminary data on the product.Examples of activities that can be supported during the Developmental (R33) stage include, but are not limited to:\n    \n \n \n     cGMP manufacturing of material for IND-enabling and/or Phase I clinical testing\n     \n \n     IND/IDE-enabling safety pharmacology and toxicology studies to determine a basis for clinical dose extrapolation using a relevant animal model\n     \n \n     IND/IDE document preparation and filing with the FDA\n      \n \n \n \n    Evidence of a pre-IND/IDE meeting with the FDA is required to submit an R33 application. \u00a0Applicants that have not achieved this requirement or are not ready for this late stage of product development should consider the companion (R61/R33) NOFO\n     \n     PAR-23-200\n     \n    .\n    \n \n \n    Milestones\n    \n \n    Delineation of milestones by the applicant is a key characteristic of this NOFO. A milestone is defined as a scheduled event in the project timeline that signifies the completion of a major project stage or activity. This NOFO will support applications that propose a series of milestones including manufacturing and product development goals. Applications that address contingency plans to proactively confront potential delays in meeting the milestones are strongly encouraged. \u00a0Milestones must be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).\n    \n \n    Prior to funding an application, program staff will contact the applicant to discuss the proposed milestones. The Program Director and the applicant will negotiate and agree on a final set of milestones.

Notice of Funding Opportunity Description PAR-25-355: Multidisciplinary Studies of HIV/AIDS and Aging (R21 Clinical Trial Optional) Section I. Notice of Funding Opportunity Description\n    \n \n \n \n    Background\n    \n \n    Currently, roughly 53%of American adults living with HIV are over the age of 50. By 2030, that number is projected to rise to over 70%. The portion of older adults with HIV is expected to rise primarily because of the successes of modern antiretroviral therapy (ART), which has allowed individuals infected at a younger age to survive into older age. Additionally, the prevalence of HIV infection in older age is attributable to new infections in later life, with approximately 16% of new diagnoses in Americans occurring in adults age 50 and older.\n    \n \n    In contrast to the pre-modern era of HIV treatment, where AIDS-related opportunistic infections and cancers were common, the most frequent morbidities and causes of death for individuals undergoing treatment for HIV infection are similar to those seen in older non-infected adults. These conditions include cardiovascular disease, lung disease, infection-related and non-infection-related cancers, neurocognitive and neuropsychiatric disorders, osteopenia/osteoporosis, liver cirrhosis, and renal disease. In addition, individuals living with HIV infection may exhibit many of the clinical and socio-behavioral characteristics commonly observed in aging, such as multiple morbidities, polypharmacy, declining physical and cognitive function, alterations in body composition, social isolation, and increasing caregiver burden. People living with HIV (PLWH) also exhibit molecular changes associated with aging, such as epigenetic alterations, mitochondrial impairment, and telomere shortening. Thus, accumulating evidence suggests that HIV and/or its treatment may lead, at least in part, to an accelerated aging phenotype. In addition, recent advances have led to greater adoption of pre-and post-exposure prophylaxis, but the impact of these measures on aging is unclear.\n    \n \n    Purpose\n    \n \n    This NOFO invites applications at the intersection of HIV and aging by proposing research that aims to meet the following objectives:\n    \n \n    1) Improve the understanding of biological, clinical, and socio-behavioral aspects of aging through the lens of HIV infection and its treatment; and\n    \n \n    2) Improve approaches for testing, preventing, and treating HIV infection, and managing HIV-related comorbidities, co-infections, and complications in different populations and cultural settings by applying current aging science approaches.\n    \n \n    Scope\n    \n \n    Proposed research must be consistent with the HIV/AIDS Research Priorities outlined by NIH\u2019s Office of AIDS Research (OAR) as described in\n     \n     NOT-OD-20-018\n     \n    . This NOFO encourages applications with the following characteristics:\n    \n \n \n \n      Clinical orientation:\n      \n     HIV in aging involves complex interactions among multiple physiologic systems and a variety of human-level factors such as functional status, quality of life, health behaviors, and psychosocial issues; therefore, studying individual factors in isolation may be counter-productive. This NOFO encourages animal models and\n      \n      in vitro\n      \n     studies where appropriate; however, inclusion of such approaches should be integrated with human studies or demonstrate direct relevance to clinical features of HIV/AIDS.\n     \n \n \n      Focus on aging or the aged:\n      \n \n \n     Applicants are strongly encouraged to enroll individuals across the range of older ages, especially individuals at the upper end of the age range (i.e., 70 years or older). Comparisons between younger and older HIV-infected populations or comparisons between older HIV-infected individuals and their age-matched non-HIV-infected counterparts are appropriate.\n     \n \n \n      Attention to geriatric outcomes:\n      \n     In addition to traditional important outcomes of HIV/AIDS research (e.g., viral load, survival), studies are encouraged to also include outcomes considered important in geriatric medicine and gerontology, such as physical and cognitive function, quality of life measures, and social support.\n     \n \n \n      Leveraging existing resources where possible:\n      \n     A variety of NIH-funded resources are available to study HIV in aging, such as longitudinal studies of HIV-infected individuals and/or their non-infected counterparts (observational or interventional), clinical networks, and research centers. Leveraging such resources through secondary analyses of available data, ancillary studies, or utilization of existing infrastructure are cost-effective approaches to testing hypotheses or generating relevant data for further studies. Please see OAR's quick reference guide on\n      \n      HIV and Aging Efforts Across NIH\n      \n     for a detailed list of relevant resources and cohort studies.\n     \n \n \n      Selection of appropriate controls\n      \n     : Aging individuals living with HIV have varied and complex clinical pictures. Biological and psychological co-morbidities, treatment regimens, lifestyle and behavioral factors, socioeconomic factors, and social support may all impact disease development, coping, and progression. This complexity presents a significant challenge to identifying appropriate control populations in observational studies of aging individuals with HIV. Such studies should include adequate justification for selection of the proposed control group(s).\n     \n \n \n      Characterization of phenotypes:\n      \n     Several biological or behavioral phenotypes of HIV in aging that have been elucidated may have markedly different disease courses, biological underpinnings, and treatment responses. Such phenotypes may be described by characteristics like frailty/disability, accelerated aging, successful aging, or other descriptors. Investigators are encouraged to maximize the homogeneity of subgroups by defining specific phenotypes in analyses.\n     \n \n \n      Exploratory/Developmental nature:\n      \n     New directions that expand or shift existing paradigms are needed to advance the science of HIV and aging. Studies that move the science into new directions with little or no preliminary data are appropriate for this mechanism.\n     \n \n \n    Interests of Specific Institutes/Centers/Offices\n    \n \n    Supporting multidisciplinary studies of HIV/AIDS and aging is consistent with the mission of multiple NIH\u00a0 Institutes, Centers, and Offices (ICOs)\n    . Below are the specific research interests of the majority of ICOs participating in this NOFO.\n    \n \n \n \n      Applicants are strongly encouraged to contact the ICO\u2019s Scientific/Research contact listed in Section VII. Agency Contacts of this NOFO\n      \n \n \n \n      prior to submission of an application\n      \n \n \n \n      to discuss the research interest of a specific ICO.\n      \n \n \n \n \n     National Institute on Aging (\n     \n \n \n      NIA\n      \n \n \n     )\n     \n \n \n    NIA is interested in understanding how biological, clinical, and socio-behavioral processes affect older individuals with HIV and their caregivers, and the social, economic, and health consequences of HIV. Example topics include the following:\n    \n \n \n     Interactions among aging-related genetic, molecular, cellular, and physiological changes with HIV risk, infection, and pathogenesis.\n     \n \n     Interactions among individual-level factors and interpersonal, social, and structural factors, and their contributions to the physical, psychological, and economic well-being of individuals; and interactions among HIV/AIDS, other disease, and population aging, particularly in low-income areas such as low-income areas of sub-Saharan Africa.\n     \n \n     Interactions among HIV infection, treatment, and development or progression of cognitive decline\u00a0(HIV-associated neurocognitive decline (HAND), dementia, and other disabilities in older adults.\n     \n \n     Interactions of HIV infection and treatment with other aging-related diseases, conditions, and syndromes and geriatrics-informed approaches to assessment and management of older adults with HIV.\n     \n \n \n \n     National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (\n     \n \n \n      NIAAA\n      \n \n \n     )\n     \n \n \n    Alcohol use disorders (AUD) are prevalent among PLWH. Consequently, PLWH and AUD are known to experience the common adverse health effects of alcohol use (organ and tissue injury and accidents such as falls) and comorbid psychological conditions (e.g., depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress, and pain). How these alcohol-related health problems and comorbidities, individually or in combination, progress as individuals age is complex and still poorly understood. In addition, alcohol use and viral expression and associated immunological responses, including progressive dysregulation of the immune system, may have additive or synergistic effects on the progression of aging.\u00a0Among individuals who drink, even treated HIV can be associated with accelerated aging, possibly from treatment sequelae or legacy effects, and notably from AUD comorbidity. Improved biomarker measurement may facilitate a more complete understanding of the mechanisms underlying accelerated aging in the context of alcohol-related comorbid conditions. In general, alcohol exposure, hazardous (and harmful) patterns of use, and AUD diagnosis are associated with different types of functional impairment (e.g., frailty). Improved management of alcohol use could lead to improved fulfillment of social roles, as well as improved HIV-related health outcomes over the lifespan. Further research is needed to take into account the important relationships between patterns of alcohol use and HIV treatment and care outcomes among PLWH as they age. Supported studies may include, but are not limited to:\n    \n \n \n     Addressing the important relationships between patterns of alcohol use and HIV treatment and care outcomes among PLWH as they age, including the development and application of innovative adaptive intervention strategies and implementation research to inform efforts to bring evidence-based interventions to population scale.\n     \n \n \n \n     National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (\n     \n \n \n      NIAMS\n      \n \n \n     )\n     \n \n \n    NIAMS encourages studies focused on the following:\n    \n \n \n     Observational, biopsychosocial/behavioral, translational, basic/pre-clinical/clinical research, and mechanistic clinical trials focused on how the process of aging in the presence or treatment of HIV/AIDS impacts diseases within the NIAMS core mission, which are more common among the aging population (e.g., rheumatologic disorders, bone fractures, osteoporosis, osteoarthritis).\n     \n \n     Interdisciplinary research aimed at elucidating factors that may drive the aging population living with HIV/AIDS to develop NIAMS mission-related diseases and understanding how the interplay between aging and HIV/AIDS may promote the acceleration or worsening of these diseases.\n     \n \n \n    NIAMS will not support applications proposing clinical trials submitted in response to this NOFO. Clinical trials instead should be submitted to a NIAMS clinical trial-specific funding opportunity (see\u00a0NIAMS'\n     \n     Investigator-Initiated Clinical Research\n     \n    web page).\u00a0Consultation with NIAMS staff is strongly recommended for investigators planning a clinical trial with a mechanistic outcome.

In the context of HIV disease, NINDS is particularly interested in the neurological complications of HIV infection that affect the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nervous system. For the purposes of this NOFO, specific topics of interest might include (but would not be limited to):\n    \n \n \n     The long-term consequences of latent HIV in the CNS as it pertains to the modulation of chronic neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment in aging; the mechanisms by which chronic HIV exacerbates long-term blood-brain barrier damage and cerebrovascular dysfunction.\n     \n \n     Studies of the mechanisms by which chronic HIV primes the CNS for neurodegeneration, including in the context of AD/ADRD and other age-associated neurodegenerative disorders.\n     \n \n     The long-term effect of chronic antiretroviral therapy (ART) exposure throughout the lifespan on the central and peripheral nervous systems.\n     \n \n     Mechanisms of HIV-associated peripheral neuropathy and chronic pain in aged individuals; and studies that address the question of whether chronic HIV infection and exposure to ART cause accelerated aging of the CNS.\n     \n \n \n    While NINDS will support studies focused on the effect of chronic HIV on cognitive outcomes in the setting of neurological disease,\n     \n     applications that are solely interested in mental health and psychiatric outcomes will not be supported by NINDS\n     \n    . This includes applications that solely rely upon RDoC-based constructs for neurobehavioral analyses. Rather, NINDS strongly prefers the incorporation of additional multidimensional measures of neurological function, such as NIH Toolbox and Neuro-QOL -based assessments of cognitive, motor, and sensory function. In addition, only mechanistic clinical trials and Basic Experimental Studies with Humans (BESH) will be supported by NINDS under this funding opportunity. Clinical trials that seek to answer specific questions about safety, tolerability, clinical efficacy, effectiveness, clinical management, and/or implementation of pharmacologic, behavioral, biologic, surgical, or device (invasive or non-invasive) interventions\n     \n     will not be supported under this NOFO\n     \n    Rather, such projects should be submitted to one of NINDS\u2019 clinical trial-specific funding announcements (such as\n     \n     PAR-22-142\n     \n    or\n     \n     PAR-21-237\n     \n    ).\n    \n \n    NINDS urges investigators to follow the\n     \n     NIH guidance for rigor and transparency in grant applications\n     \n    and additionally recommends the research practices described on\n     \n     NINDS' resource web page on preparing\n      \n      applications\n      \n \n \n \n    to ensure that robust experiments are designed, potential experimenter biases are minimized, results and analyses are transparently reported, and results are interpreted carefully. These recommended research practices include, where applicable: rationale for the chosen model(s) and primary/secondary endpoints, clear descriptions of tools and parameters, blinding, randomization, ensuring adequate sample size, pre-specified inclusion/exclusion criteria, handling of missing data and outliers, appropriate controls, preplanned analyses, appropriate quantitative techniques, clear indication of exploratory vs. confirmatory components of the study, consideration of limitations, and plans for transparent reporting of all methods, analyses, and results so that other investigators can evaluate the quality of the work and potentially perform replications.\n    \n \n \n     National Cancer Institute (\n     \n \n \n      NCI\n      \n \n \n     )\n     \n \n \n    Recent data indicates an increase in a variety of cancer types (e.g., anus, liver, oral cavity/pharynx, lung, and Hodgkin lymphoma), which is driven primarily by the growth and aging of PLWH who are on highly effective antiretroviral therapy. Aging is, by itself, a key factor promoting the development of many cancers, and HIV infection can itself cause certain manifestations of premature aging. There is a lack of data on the interplay between aging, HIV, long-term exposure to antiretroviral drugs, and other factors promoting cancer development in PLWH who are aging. In addition, there is little understanding of the interplay between host factors and immune perturbations that occur in aging and how these interactions affect cancers that are mostly seen in older people (e.g., clonal hematopoiesis and biological aging). \u00a0Therefore, NCI is interested in applications proposing studies on the following:\n    \n \n \n     Research studies to help understand how aging in the presence of chronic HIV infection affects the risk, spectrum, and biology of cancer in PLWH.\n     \n \n     Cancer treatment outcomes and survivorship in PLWH.\n     \n \n \n \n     Office of Research on Women's Health (\n     \n \n \n      ORWH\n      \n \n \n     )\n     \n \n \n    ORWH is part of NIH's Office of the Director.

Criteria\n    \n \n    Only the review criteria described below will be considered in the review process. Applications submitted to the NIH in support of the\n     \n     NIH mission\n     \n    are evaluated for scientific and technical merit through the NIH peer review system.\n    \n \n \n \n    For this particular announcement, note the following:\n    \n \n    The R21 exploratory/developmental grant supports investigation of novel scientific ideas or new model systems, tools, or technologies that have the potential for significant impact on biomedical or biobehavioral research. An R21 grant application need not have extensive background material or preliminary information. Accordingly, reviewers will emphasize the conceptual framework, the level of innovation, and the potential to significantly advance our knowledge or understanding. Appropriate justification for the proposed work can be provided through literature citations, data from other sources, or, when available, from investigator-generated data. Preliminary data are not required for R21 applications; however, they may be included if available.\n    \n \n \n   Overall Impact\n    \n    Reviewers will provide an overall impact score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood for the project to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the research field(s) involved, in consideration of the following scored review criteria and additional review criteria (as applicable for the project proposed). An application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged likely to have a major scientific impact.\n    \n \n \n   Scored Review Criteria\n    \n    Reviewers will consider Factors 1, 2 and 3 in the determination of scientific merit, and in providing an overall impact score. In addition, Factors 1 and 2 will each receive a separate factor score.\n    \n \n \n \n    Factor 1. Importance of the Research (Significance and Innovation)\n    \n \n \n \n \n \n        Significance\n        \n \n \n \n \n       Evaluate the importance of the proposed research in the context of current scientific challenges and opportunities, either for advancing knowledge within the field, or more broadly. Assess whether the application addresses an important gap in knowledge in the field, would solve a critical problem, or create a valuable conceptual or technical advance.\n       \n \n       Evaluate the rationale for undertaking the study, the rigor of the scientific background for the work (e.g., prior literature and/or preliminary data) and whether the scientific background justifies the proposed study.\n       \n \n \n \n \n        Innovation\n        \n \n \n \n \n       Evaluate the extent to which innovation influences the importance of undertaking the proposed research.

Notice of Funding Opportunity Description PAR-25-343: NIDCD Cooperative Agreement for Clinical Trials in Communication Disorders (U01 - Clinical Trial Required) Section I. Notice of Funding Opportunity Description\n    \n \n \n \n    The purpose of this funding opportunity is to encourage cooperative agreement applications to the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communications Disorders (NIDCD) for investigator initiated clinical trials in communication disorders (hearing, balance, taste, smell, voice, speech and language) with the goal of advancing interventions into standard clinical care through well-designed and well-implemented clinical trials.\n    \n \n    The NIH defines a clinical trial as a research study in which one or more human subjects are prospectively assigned to one or more interventions (which may include placebo or other control) to evaluate the effects of those interventions on health-related biomedical or behavioral outcomes.

Notice of Funding Opportunity Description PAR-25-338: Academic-Industrial Partnerships for Translation of Technologies for Diagnosis and Treatment (R01 - Clinical Trial Not Allowed) Section I. Notice of Funding Opportunity Description\n    \n \n \n \n    Purpose\n    \n \n    The purpose of this Notice of Funding Opportunity Announcement (NOFO) is to stimulate efforts to translate scientific discoveries and engineering developments into methods or tools that address problems in basic research to understand disease, or in applied research to assess risk, detect, prevent, diagnose, treat, and/or manage disease. The rationale is to deliver new capabilities to meet evolving requirements for technologies and methods relevant to the advance of research and delivery of care in pre-clinical, clinical and non-clinical settings, domestic or foreign, for conditions and diseases within the missions of participating institutes.\n    \n \n    This NOFO specifies a partnership structure that is expected to help bridge gaps in knowledge and experience by engaging the strengths of academic, industrial, and other investigators. The partners on each application should establish an inter-disciplinary, multi-institutional research team to work in strategic alliance to implement a coherent strategy to develop and translate a solution to their chosen problem. They are expected to plan, design, and validate that the solution will be suitable for end users. Each partnership should include at least one academic and one industrial organization. Each partnership should plan to transition a technology, method, assay, device, and/or system from a demonstration of possibility to a status useful in the chosen setting. Funding may be requested to enhance, adapt, optimize, validate, and otherwise translate technologies that address problems in biology, pathology, risk assessment, detection, diagnosis, treatment, and/or monitoring of disease status.\n    \n \n \n     Examples of possible advances may include, but are not limited to:\n     \n \n \n \n     Affordability;\n     \n \n     Commercially supported systems;\n     \n \n     Next-generation systems;\n     \n \n     Quality assurance, quality control;\n     \n \n     Management of reproducibility, error propagation;\n     \n \n     Validation, Correlation studies;\n     \n \n     Quantification methods;\n     \n \n     Research resources;\n     \n \n     Calibration, software applications;\n     \n \n     Integrative bioinformatics;\n     \n \n     Consensus or standard usage across different commercial platforms or sites;\n     \n \n     Extensions to low resource settings, or underserved populations;\n     \n \n     Knowledge-based systems;\n     \n \n     Machine learning, artificial intelligence;\n     \n \n     Automated predictive analysis;\n     \n \n     Analytical and clinical validation using clinical samples, and correlation studies; and\n     \n \n \n    This NOFO defines innovation as likelihood to deliver a new capability to end users. This definition of innovation is deliberately broad to accommodate a wide range of projects and their problems in need of solutions. For example, objectives may include adaptations of existing or new technologies or methods affordable for use in any setting, including those with low resources or underserved populations.\n    \n \n    Background and Research Objectives\n    \n \n    The rationale of this NOFO is to deliver new capabilities to meet evolving requirements for technologies and methods relevant to the advance of research and delivery of care in pre-clinical, clinical and non-clinical settings, domestic or foreign. This NOFO specifies a partnership structure expected to help bridge gaps in investigator knowledge and experience by engaging the strengths of academic, industrial, and other investigators. They are expected to plan, design, and solve a problem, and validate it as suitable for end users.\n    \n \n    Key parties are expected to participate from the beginning. The academic-industrial partnership may include any number of participants and organizations necessary to assemble a critical mass of expertise and know-how for effective execution. The level of participation is expected to vary among the partners as necessary to reach the specific translational research goals proposed. The strategic alliance is expected to combine research strengths, laboratory, and other resources unique to each group to advance the translational research goal. Industrial involvement from the beginning is expected to facilitate more efficient transfer of intellectual property to the commercial setting. For example, it is likely final outcomes would improve if the investigators chose from the start to adopt industry's focus on manufacturability and reliability. For clinically oriented projects, routine use of good laboratory practices (GLP) and good manufacturing practices (GMP) would reduce risk and raise the likelihood of meeting FDA standards and consumer expectations. Commercialization of the proposed technologies would be the usual goal, but is not necessarily the only path to sustainable dissemination that is a critical objective of this NOFO.This NOFO will support work up to the point of pre-commercial production, but specifically does not support commercial production.\n    \n \n    Technology translation to solve a target problem may focus on clinical research, clinical care delivery, or non-clinical research. Technological improvements may focus on reproducibility, reliability, rapidity, ease of use, or affordability.\n    \n \n    Partnerships of academics and their affiliated start-up technology companies are allowable so long as financial conflicts of interests will be managed in compliance with Department of Health and Human Services and National Institutes of Health policy as described in 42 CFR part 50. The level of participation and budget details are expected to vary among the partners as necessary to achieve the specific aims proposed. The investigators have the discretion to set effort levels and apportion budget according to the timing and other project requirements at each research step.\n    \n \n    Each academic-industrial partnership is encouraged to solve its targeted problem within the funding period. This NOFO will support the placement of copies of prototypes in multiple research sites for study and validation of performance.\n    \n \n \n     Possible technologies designed to address a targeted problem as defined in this NOFO include, but are not limited to, the following:\n     \n \n \n \n     Development, integration and validation of new molecular diagnosis, imaging or spectroscopy systems, technologies, methods, assays, or devices, related component technologies, molecular diagnostic technology, image processing methods, and development of informatics tools; for example, non-stain molecular contrast methods for pathology slide microscopy, such as molecular bond vibrational spectroscopic imaging maps.\n     \n \n     Implementation of research methods on one version or multiple manufacturer's versions of commercial platforms, where appropriate;\n     \n \n     Harmonization of data collection and data analysis across single and/or different commercial platforms to reduce the sources of uncertainty in use of biomarkers or other research areas as required for multi-site preclinical or clinical investigations, these efforts may include development of open computer platforms and open source software tools.\n     \n \n     Development of shared resources, data archives, and other approaches intended to facilitate consensus methods for optimization and validation of emerging technologies and methods; it is understood that many commercial entities develop open source tools to support validation of technologies and such applications are encouraged.\n     \n \n \n \n     Applications appropriate for this NOFO require the following attributes:\n     \n \n \n \n     Contain research partnerships formed by academic and industrial investigators, and any other participants to assure the group has a critical mass of essential skills and know-how to perform the translational aims proposed;\n     \n \n     Propose to enhance, adapt, optimize, validate, and otherwise translate a technology, method, assay, device, or system for diagnosis, imaging or spectroscopy for (a) current commercially supported system, (b) next-generation system, (c) quality assurance and quality control, (d) validation and correlation studies, (e) quantitative methods, (f) related research resource, or (g) other possibilities;\n     \n \n     Propose to mitigate or solve a targeted problem in risk assessment, detection, diagnosis, staging, treatment, and/or treatment monitoring;\n     \n \n     Propose to accomplish substantial progress toward delivery of their translated product as a new capability for use by end users in pre-clinical, clinical research or clinical care;\n     \n \n     Propose to develop or adapt a technology for a low resource setting or underserved population.\n     \n \n \n    IC-Specific Interests\n    \n \n \n     National Cancer Institute (NCI)\n     \n \n \n    The\n     \n     NCI\n     \n    leads, conducts, and supports cancer research across the nation to advance scientific knowledge and help all people live longer, healthier lives. As the leader of the cancer research enterprise, collectively known as the National Cancer Program, and the largest funder of cancer research in the world, NCI manages a broad range of research, training, and information dissemination activities that reach across the entire country, meeting the needs of all demographics rich and poor, urban and rural, and all racial/ethnic populations.\n    \n \n    Examples of technologies that are of interest to NCI include, but are not limited to:\n    \n \n \n     For tissue\n      \n      ex vivo\n      \n     or\n      \n      in vivo\n      \n     imaging and integration for detection/diagnosis/prognosis\n     \n \n     For measuring immune health status, immune processes (e.g., immunocompetence, resilience, immune surveillance) or for evaluating functional capacity of cancer-relevant immune cells, neoantigen presenting or binding immune cells, or durability of natural anti-tumor immune response\n     \n \n     For primary and secondary lymphoid organ function tests\n     \n \n     To monitor immunotoxicity, cancer associated opportunistic infections, cytokine release syndrome, and cancer treatment-related adverse events\n     \n \n     Point-of-care or point-of-need tools for predicting cancer risk, detection, diagnosis, prognosis, or minimal residual disease, and affordable technologies for rural cancer care\n     \n \n     Next-generation non-invasive or minimally invasive diagnostics platforms e.g., liquid biopsy-based multiomic analysis platforms.\n     \n \n     For producing next generation cancer therapeutics, including nanobody-based diagnostics, theragnostics or therapeutics;\n      \n      in vivo\n      \n     editing;\n      \n      in vitro\n      \n     and\n      \n      in vivo\n      \n     engineering of immune cells for immunotherapy, or immune modulation.\n     \n \n     DL/ML/AI based models/foundation models that integrate one or more data types.\n     \n \n     For analysis of exposures, including environmental and chemical exposures, and cancer-relevant microbiome and virome; host-microbiome interactions, and tools for gene-environment interaction.\n     \n \n     Tools for cancer care coordination;\u00a0 and wearable devices and biosensors to monitor lifestyle factors and cancer-relevant exposures; and population scale dissemination tools\n     \n \n \n \n     National Eye Institute (NEI)\n     \n \n \n    The mission of the National Eye Institute (NEI) is to eliminate vision loss and improve quality of life through vision research. The NEI invites applications for research that aligns with our\n     \n     strategic plan\n     \n    . The NEI is interested in stimulating translation of novel diagnostics, scientific discoveries, and therapies to treat diseases and disorders of the visual system, especially blinding eye diseases such as glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration, retinitis pigmentosa and other conditions of the visual nervous system.\u00a0 Each project must have a well-defined endpoint, achievable within a five-year time frame, for developing a diagnostic or treatment for a specific disease or disorder of the visual system.\u00a0 Investigators are strongly encouraged to contact NEI scientific/research contact prior to submission, to ensure this is the correct NOFO for their proposed research.\n    \n \n    The National Eye Institute (NEI) strongly encourages applicants to use common formats for files and metadata standards when incorporating ocular imaging in their research proposals (see\n     \n     NOT-EY-24-006\n     \n    ). This applies to both clinical and nonclinical research applications submitted in response to NOFOs where NEI is the issuing or participating organization. It is anticipated the widespread adoption of standardized imaging formats will significantly advance the field by 1) simplifying streamlined digital workflows; 2) enhancing interoperability of large datasets; and 3) developing extensive and comprehensive training sets for artificial intelligence driven research. By promoting these standards, the NEI goal is to create an environment where data can be seamlessly integrated and analyzed across different studies, thereby, amplifying the overall impact of vision research.\n    \n \n \n     Office of Research on Women\u2019s Health (\n     \n \n \n      ORWH\n      \n \n \n     )\n     \n \n \n    ORWH is part of the Office of the Director, NIH, and works with the 27 NIH Institutes and Centers to advance rigorous research of relevance to the health of women. ORWH does not award grants but co-funds women\u2019s health-related applications and research projects that have received an award from one of the participating NIH Institutes and Centers (ICs) listed in the announcement.

Notice of Funding Opportunity Description PAR-25-154: HEAL Initiative-Early-Stage Discovery of New Pain Targets Within the Understudied Druggable Proteome (R03 Clinical Trial Not Allowed) Section I. Notice of Funding Opportunity Description\n    \n \n \n \n \n     Introduction\n     \n \n \n    This study is part of the Helping to End Addiction Long-term\n     \n     \u00ae\n     \n    Initiative, or NIH HEAL Initiative\n     \n     \u00ae\n     \n    , to speed scientific solutions to the national opioid public health crisis. The NIH HEAL Initiative bolsters research across NIH to (1) improve treatment for opioid misuse and addiction and (2) enhance pain management. More information about the HEAL Initiative is available at:\n     \n     https://heal.nih.gov/\n     \n    .\n    \n \n    This notice of funding opportunity (NOFO) aims to promote innovative research to increase knowledge of understudied proteins in the context of pain and pain management. The submission of small research grant (R03) applications is encouraged from institutions and organizations proposing projects leading to a better understanding of eligible proteins listed below.\n    \n \n    Small research (R03) grants provide flexibility for initiating discrete, well-defined projects that realistically can be completed in one year and require only limited levels of funding. This program supports different types of projects including, but not limited to, the following:\n    \n \n \n     Pilot or feasibility studies;\n     \n \n     Small, self-contained research projects;\n     \n \n     Development of research methodology; and/or\n     \n \n     Development of assays to support compound screening projects;\n     \n \n     Development of human cell or animal based models.\n     \n \n \n    These awards will support generation of preliminary data and tools around eligible understudied protein(s) with the intent of elucidating the function of these proteins in the context of pain and obtaining sufficient preliminary data and/or research resources for subsequent grant applications and/or drug discovery projects. These grants are non-renewable.\n    \n \n    This Funding Opportunity Announcement does not accept applications proposing clinical trial(s).\n    \n \n \n     Objectives and Scope\n     \n \n \n    The goal of this notice of funding opportunity (NOFO) is to provide a needed opportunity for the collection of preliminary data around the role of understudied proteins in the context of pain and pain management. This NOFO would provide funding to support research that will identify new targets for pain among the understudied proteins of the Druggable Proteome (DP). Many understudied proteins have been linked to pain or pain perception, acute and chronic pain. This indicates that there could be many more proteins within the DP that could serve as markers and/or drug targets for novel pain treatment and/or pain management.\n    \n \n    It has been recognized through workshops and publications that understudied proteins become illuminated when (1) there are tools to study the protein (e.g., tools that modulate protein activity) and/or (2) there is biochemical, cellular, or animal model evidence of disease/physiological relevance. This NOFO was developed to address the need for expanded research and validation experiments on eligible understudied protein(s), with the intent of producing preliminary data to address the lack of biochemical, cellular, or animal model data associated with many understudied proteins. It is expected that the award will be used to obtain preliminary data and/or research resources for subsequent grant applications and/or drug discovery projects. These projects should be carried out in a short period of time with limited resources as defined by the funding mechanism.\n    \n \n    Understudied proteins eligible for study under this NOFO are from well-established druggable protein families with a high potential to impact human health once a disease association is made.\u00a0 Proteins considered eligible for this funding opportunity have a Pubmed score of less than 10 (derived from text mining Pubmed extracts, this counts the number of publications that focus on a particular protein, and includes fractional counting of abstracts that mention multiple proteins [\n     \n     Pletscher-Frankild\u2019s et al. 2015\n     \n    ]) and have minimal funded awards associated with their study.\n    \n \n \n     Proteins open for study

Application Review Information\n    \n \n \n \n    1. Criteria\n    \n \n    Only the review criteria described below will be considered in the review process. Applications submitted to the NIH in support of the\n     \n     NIH mission\n     \n    are evaluated for scientific and technical merit through the NIH peer review system.\n    \n \n \n \n    For this particular announcement, note the following:\n    \n \n    The R03 small grant supports discrete, well-defined projects that realistically can be completed in one year and that require limited levels of funding. Because the research project usually is limited, an R03 grant application may not contain extensive detail or discussion. Accordingly, reviewers should evaluate the conceptual framework and general approach to the problem. Appropriate justification for the proposed work can be provided through literature citations, data from other sources, or from investigator-generated data. Preliminary data are not required, particularly in applications proposing pilot or feasibility studies.\n    \n \n \n   Overall Impact\n    \n    Reviewers will provide an overall impact score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood for the project to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the research field(s) involved, in consideration of the following scored review criteria and additional review criteria (as applicable for the project proposed). An application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged likely to have a major scientific impact.\n    \n \n \n   Scored Review Criteria\n    \n    Reviewers will evaluate Factors 1, 2 and 3 in the determination of scientific merit, and in providing an overall impact score. In addition, Factors 1 and 2 will each receive a separate criterion score.\n    \n \n \n \n    Factor 1.

Notice of Funding Opportunity Description\n    \n \n \n \n \n     Purpose\n     \n \n \n    The healthcare landscape in the United States and globally is constantly changing, creating new challenges to the delivery of high-quality treatments and services to children, youth, adults, and older adults with unmet or under-met mental health needs. Epidemiological findings suggest that approximately one-half of the United States population meets lifetime criteria for a mental illness, and approximately one-fifth of people over 18 years old meet criteria in any given year. However, only one-half of people with any mental health disorders and only two-thirds of adults with a serious mental health disorder received mental health services in the previous year. Among young adults with serious mental illness, approximately half received mental health services in the previous year. Of those who find their way into mental health care, many quickly fall out of care and/or do not receive guideline-concordant treatment. Statistics for low- and middle-income countries (\n     \n     LMICs)\n     \n    show even lower rates of treatment. Health disparities among certain populations (e.g., members of racial, ethnic, sexual and gender minority communities), a fragmented healthcare system, provider shortages, healthcare affordability, and other factors moderate these findings. Innovative mental health services research is needed to improve access, continuity, quality, equity, efficiency, and value of mental health services, and to bring effective strategies to scale to maximize public health impact.\n    \n \n \n     Research Scope and Opportunities\n     \n \n \n    This notice of funding opportunity (NOFO) is intended to foster pilot mental health services research in strategic but understudied areas where new knowledge has the potential for high public health impact. This NOFO supports non-clinical trials research, including but not limited to\u00a0 natural experiments (that are not clinical trials), survey or mixed methods research, clinical epidemiology, and development and refinement of new research methods, measures, financing approaches, or statistical approaches related to mental health services research. Services research can target patients, providers, healthcare leaders and administrators, and/or healthcare systems or other organizations that provide services to persons with mental disorders, including those with early psychosis or autism spectrum disorders across the lifespan. NIMH encourages investigators to design their applications to maximize the likelihood that findings will meaningfully inform future research and/or be translated rapidly into practice, whether at the patient, clinical, healthcare/other system, or policy level. Studies involving providers, technologies, and workflows that generate results that can inform future studies of implementation in routine care settings are encouraged. Studies\u00a0(using non trial designs) that are seeking to develop, refine, or evaluate services or system interventions, should employ methods that seek to understand how, why, for whom, and/or in what circumstances the intervention may be effective.\u00a0 That is, methodology should go beyond evaluating simply whether an intervention is effective. Studies that evaluate interventions must not employ\n     \n     NIH-defined clinical trial designs\n     \n    (e.g., must not prospectively assign participants to one or more interventions).\n    \n \n    NIMH encourages investigators to develop and leverage strong research-practice partnerships with public and private stakeholders, so that the research follows a deployment-focused model of services design and testing. Deployment-focused studies consider the perspective of relevant stakeholders and key characteristics of settings intended to implement optimized mental health interventions. This attention to end-user perspectives and characteristics of intended clinical and/or community practice settings is intended to ensure that resultant interventions and service delivery strategies are feasible and scalable, and to ensure that the research results will have utility for end users. Such stakeholders include, but are not limited to, federal agencies (e.g.,\n     \n     Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services\n     \n    ,\n     \n     Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration\n     \n    ,\n     \n     Health Resources and Services Administration\n     \n    ,\n     \n     U.S. Department of Defense\n     \n    ,\n     \n     Department of Veterans Affairs\n     \n    ); state agencies, including state Medicaid leadership; commercial health insurers and/or funders; public and commercial disability insurers; employers and other payers; delivery systems; professional and/or trade associations; accrediting and licensing organizations; medical education and other clinician training programs; clinicians; vendors of information technology and other relevant products and/or services; service users; family members; and community organizations or comparable institutions and stakeholders in LMICs. Such communication and collaboration will ensure findings are relevant and practical, create opportunities for research that is not otherwise feasible, and enable stakeholders to anticipate relevant research initiatives in their planning and activities.\n    \n \n    Given the critical need for practice-relevant research in community and practice settings, collaborations between academic investigators and clinical or community practice partners or networks are encouraged. When possible, studies should capitalize on existing infrastructure (e.g., practice-based research networks such as the NIMH-sponsored Mental Health Research Network (MHRN) and the Early Psychosis Intervention Network (\n     \n     EPINET\n     \n    );\n     \n     NIMH-sponsored ALACRITY Research Centers\n     \n    ; NIMH-sponsored suicide research centers\n     \n     NIMH-sponsored Scale-Up Hubs\n     \n    ; electronic medical records, administrative databases, patient registries, institutions with Clinical and Translational Science Awards) to increase the efficiency of participant recruitment, data collection and management.\n    \n \n    NIMH is committed to supporting research that reduces disparities and advances equity in mental health interventions, services, and outcomes. Accordingly, this NOFO encourages pilot research on innovative service delivery models that seek to reduce disparities in service access, quality, and outcomes for racial and ethnic minority groups, individuals limited by language or cultural barriers, sexual and gender minorities, individuals living in rural areas, socioeconomically disadvantaged persons and other underserved groups.\n    \n \n    Under this NOFO, NIMH seeks pilot mental health services research applications that align with\n     \n     Goal 4 of the NIMH Strategic Plan\n      \n      for Research\n      \n \n    . Examples of high priority research include, but are not limited to, the following.\n    \n \n    Research improving the efficiency, reach, and clinical impact of existing mental health services:\n    \n \n \n     Developing and evaluating performance feedback systems, decision support tools, and quality improvement processes, which can be utilized across a range of systems (e.g., primary care, schools, criminal justice system, child welfare agencies) or levels within a single system to optimize the delivery of effective mental health interventions.\n     \n \n     Developing pragmatic, valid, and reliable measures of intervention fidelity, quality, and treatment outcomes, including outcome-focused quality measures, that can be applied at the patient, clinician, clinic, system, and/or population levels.\n     \n \n     Identifying mutable factors, including patient, provider, organizational, and policy-level factors, to include social determinants of health, that are likely to influence disparities in healthcare access, continuity, quality, and mental health outcomes for racial and ethnic minorities and other underserved groups. Social determinants of health include, but are not limited to, housing, food security, employment, social contact, and education.\u00a0 Social determinants of health may be operationalized in multi-level terms. These identified factors should serve as targets for future intervention development and testing.\n     \n \n     Investigating alternative financing mechanisms, service purchasing mechanisms, inclusion in publicly funded benefit baskets, policies, regulations, and healthcare system rules, to include provider- or payer-level incentives, that promote high value (e.g., clinically effective and efficient) care, including integrated medical and psychosocial treatment approaches, and discourage low-value services.\n     \n \n     Evaluating existing strategies\u00a0to enhance treatment engagement and adherence (e.g., shared decision-making or behavioral economic approaches to behavior change).\n     \n \n \n    Research that informs the expeditious adoption, scaling, sustained implementation, and continuous quality improvement of evidence-based mental health or autism services as part of a learning healthcare system:\n    \n \n \n     Improving the dissemination, implementation, and delivery of evidence-based prevention and treatment practices in community mental health centers and non-specialty care settings (e.g., primary medical care, schools, online and virtual communities).\n     \n \n     Examining mutable patient-, provider-, organizational-, and policy-level factors that influence the degree to which evidence-based interventions are implemented with fidelity, and sustained over time, to include mutable factors that influence sustainment after the research project period has ended.\n     \n \n     Systematic, data-guided quality improvement activities that rigorously examine mental health care processes and outcomes within healthcare systems, to inform potential strategies that could lead to rapid, durable, and generalizable improvements in access and continuity of services, quality of care, and mental health outcomes at the individual and population-level.\n     \n \n     Designing and/or validating instruments to measure dissemination, implementation, or sustainability processes; changes in service user functioning or provider practice over time; or organizational or systems processes related to access and continuity of services, quality of care, and mental health outcomes at the individual and population levels.\n     \n \n     Employing studies (with quasi-experimental or quality improvement designs and methodologies that are not clinical trials) that simultaneously evaluate the effectiveness and implementation of mental health services to enhance the delivery of evidence-based mental health practices and improve implementation of mental health services to enhance the delivery of evidence-based mental health practices and improve implementation outcomes (e.g., fidelity, acceptability, feasibility, appropriateness, penetration, and sustainability of services).\n     \n \n \n    Research on innovative service delivery models to reduce or eliminate known health disparities related to race, ethnicity, geography, sexual and gender minority status and/or socioeconomic status, to dramatically improve outcomes in understudied populations in diverse United States and global communities, and to ensure high value mental health services are readily accessible to those in need:\n    \n \n \n     Using innovative technologies (e.g., mobile devices, health information systems, social networking platforms) to improve early detection of mental illnesses, engaging and connecting service users to evidence-based care, and increasing the reach, clinical impact, and scalability of services for underserved populations in diverse settings.\n     \n \n     Developing and examining strategies for delivering evidence-based mental health services in non-specialty settings (e.g., primary care, criminal justice system, community-based programs providing mental health services to military or veteran populations, colleges or other academic settings, the child welfare system, or geriatric service settings), and leveraging those strategies to bolster the delivery of high-quality evidence-based care in specialty care settings.\n     \n \n     Investigating the role of peer specialists to improve access, engagement, and effectiveness of services for people with mental illnesses, with or without co-occurring medical and other conditions. This research may address related issues such as optimal integration of peer specialist staff in service delivery systems and financing of such services.\n     \n \n     Studying service delivery models that fully integrate treatment for mental illnesses with primary medical care, including medical decision models for treating mental illnesses and multiple chronic conditions.\n     \n \n     Using non-clinical trial methodology (e.g., natural experiments) to evaluate service delivery models for comorbid conditions, such as care decision models that integrate treatment for mental illness and medical conditions, including service delivery interventions to identify, prevent, and reduce modifiable health risks associated with premature mortality in people with serious mental illnesses.\n     \n \n \n    Research to evaluate the public health impact of mental health services or autism services innovation using large representative data sets and novel computational approaches:\n    \n \n \n     Using electronic health record data to examine the clinical epidemiology, service utilization, response to treatment, and health state transitions of people with mental health needs within or across large systems responsible for mental health service delivery.\n     \n \n     Monitoring real-time trends in suicidal behavior, serious mental illness, and other mental illnesses that generally go unrecognized in health care and other settings (e.g., school, work, and home) and promoting effective data-driven planning to improve detection and help seeking in these populations.\n     \n \n     Developing and using big data and commensurate analytic approaches (e.g., predictive analytics, machine learning, artificial intelligence, large language models, etc.) for the purposes of understanding concentrations of risk and optimizing mental health care.\n     \n \n     Developing, refining, or applying new methodological and computational approaches for the analysis of complex and dynamic systems affecting mental health outcomes, with the goal of demonstrating the impact of such factors on client outcomes.\n     \n \n     Developing sampling frames and leveraging/enhancing existing epidemiological datasets to understand mental health needs in treatment seeking and general populations.\n     \n \n \n \n     Applications Not Responsive to this NOFO.\n     \n \n \n    The following types of studies are not responsive to this NOFO. Applications proposing such studies will be considered non-responsive and will not be reviewed or considered for funding.\n    \n \n \n     Applications that do not include mental health services research.\n     \n \n     Applications whose scope of work primarily involves the provision of direct services (e.g., the creation of a clinic or center).\n     \n \n     Applications that have no clearly articulated relevance to people with or who are at risk for mental illness or autism spectrum disorder.\n     \n \n     Studies focused on stigma or health literacy that examine knowledge about or attitudes towards mental health and mental health care without also examining mental health policy, actual service access, engagement, quality and/or outcomes of care.\n     \n \n     Applications that propose a clinical trial.\n     \n \n \n    Mental health services research questions that require a clinical trial design must be submitted via the appropriate NIMH Clinical Trials Funding Opportunity Announcement (see\n     \n     Support for Clinical Trials at NIMH\n     \n    ).

IMPORTANCE OF THE RESEARCH (SIGNIFICANCE)\n    \n \n \n     Detail how the proposed research will generate data that will lead to a firm conclusion about the feasibility of a regular research project grant (e.g., an R01 application) and provide information about the anticipated scope and goals of intended future work.\n     \n \n     For projects involving methods development and testing, describe the potential for broad use of results in studies of other target populations and/or outcomes.\n     \n \n     Describe collaborations and/or input from community partners and relevant policymakers/health leaders. Discuss how information gleaned from these relationships influenced the development of the research, ensure it is deployment-focused (as defined above) and/or deployed and sustained if study is successful, and/or will help ensure that the results will have utility to community practice and/or other relevant stakeholders or end users of the research.\n     \n \n     Address the potential public health impact of the proposed work in terms of a) reach and effect on the target populations, and/or b) meaningfulness of the anticipated outcome(s) compared to existing approaches and/or current state of science in the topic area.\n     \n \n     For studies involving services interventions (e.g., research with quasi-experimental or quality improvement designs and methodologies that are not clinical trials), address the degree to which the proposed services intervention is scalable and could be broadly implemented using typically available resources, staff, and service structures, including financing mechanisms.\n     \n \n \n    IMPORTANCE OF THE RESEARCH (INNOVATION)\n    \n \n \n     Highlight any innovative research strategies and design or analytic elements that are being used and describe the potential of these to enhance the relevance and usefulness of study findings.\n     \n \n     Describe how any use of information technology contributes to new knowledge and/or research efficiency, and/or has the potential to contribute significantly to improved outcomes.\n     \n \n \n    Factor 2. RIGOR AND FEASIBILITY (APPROACH)\n    \n \n \n     Describe factors that are mutable and have the potential to serve as targets in future intervention development that impact access, continuity, utilization, quality, value, financing, equitability, outcomes, or scalability of mental health or autism services.\n     \n \n     For applications that propose to develop and test new research tools, measures, or methods, describe how the research will lead to validated and deployable products, services, and/or methodologies that are broadly and efficiently usable in community practice settings.\n     \n \n     For applications that propose to integrate and/or analyze existing data sets, discuss how results will enhance and extend our understanding of factors affecting access, continuity, quality, delivery, efficiency, financing, value, equitability, or outcomes of care.\n     \n \n     Describe any planned collaboration or input from stakeholders and describe how these will contribute to the utility of study results. Beyond providing letters of support, consider proposing an advisory board that includes relevant stakeholders and decision makers (e.g., local, state, or federal policymakers; health system executives) or strategically including such decision makers as part of the study team.\n     \n \n     Provide evidence that outcomes measures are valid and reliable, including measures of outcomes that are meaningful to the stakeholders involved.\n     \n \n     For studies that involve the assessment of patient-level outcomes, describe plans for the detection of suicidal behavior/ideation and non-suicidal self-harm, and for clinical management to reduce subject risk when these factors are identified.\n     \n \n \n    Factor 3. EXPERTISE AND RESOURCES (ENVIRONMENT)\n    \n \n \n     Describe how the study will leverage resources and expertise from existing infrastructure (e.g., CTSAs; practice-based research networks; other NIMH investments like the Mental Health Research Network, ALACRITY Research Centers, and\n      \n      EPINET;\n      \n     electronic medical records; administrative databases; patient registries) or utilize other available resources to increase the efficiency of participant recruitment and data collection. Or, provide a justification in the event that such efficiencies cannot be incorporated.\n     \n \n \n \n \n \n     Resource Sharing Plan\n     \n    :\u00a0Individuals are required to comply with the instructions for the Resource Sharing Plans as provided in the How to Apply- Application Guide.\n    \n \n \n \n \n     Other Plan(s):\n     \n \n \n    All instructions in the How to Apply-Application Guide must be followed, with the following additional instructions:\n    \n \n \n \n \n     All applicants planning research (funded or conducted in whole or in part by NIH) that results in the generation of scientific data are required to comply with the instructions for the Data Management and Sharing Plan. All applications, regardless of the amount of direct costs requested for any one year, must address a Data Management and Sharing Plan.\n     \n \n \n    To advance the goal of advancing research through widespread data sharing among researchers, investigators funded by NIMH under this NOFO are expected to share those data via the\n     \n     National Institute of Mental Health Data Archive\n     \n    (NDA; see\n     \n     NOT-MH-23-100\n     \n    ). Established by the NIH, NDA is a secure informatics platform for scientific collaboration and data-sharing that enables the effective communication of detailed research data, tools, and supporting documentation. NDA links data across research projects through its Global Unique Identifier (GUID) and Data Dictionary technology. Investigators funded under this NOFO are expected to use these technologies to submit data to NDA.\n    \n \n    To accomplish this objective, it will be important to formulate a) an enrollment strategy that will obtain the information necessary to generate a GUID for each participant, and b) a budget strategy that will cover the costs of data submission. The\n     \n     NDA\n     \n    website provides two tools to help investigators develop appropriate strategies: 1)\n     \n     t\n     \n \n     he NDA Data Submission Cost Model\n     \n    which offers a customizable Excel worksheet that includes tasks and hours for the Program Director/Principal Investigator and Data Manager to budget for data sharing; and 2) plain language text to be considered in your informed consent available from the NDA's\n     \n     Data Contribution page\n     \n    . Investigators are expected to certify the quality of all data generated by grants funded under this NOFO prior to submission to NDA and review their data for accuracy after submission. Submission of descriptive/raw data is expected semi-annually (every January 15 and July 15); submission of all other data is expected at the time of publication, or prior to the end of the grant, whichever occurs first (see\n     \n     NDA Sharing Regimen\n     \n    for more information); Investigators are expected to share results, positive and negative, specific to the cohorts and outcome measures studied.For more guidance on submitting data to NDA, refer to the\n     \n     NDA Data Management and Sharing Plan on the NDA website\n     \n    .

Intergovernmental Review (E.O. 12372)\n    \n \n    This initiative is not subject to\n     \n     intergovernmental review.\n     \n \n \n \n \n \n     Use of Common Data Elements in NIH-funded Research\n     \n \n \n    Many NIH ICs encourage the use of common data elements (CDEs) in basic, clinical, and applied research, patient registries, and other human subject research to facilitate broader and more effective use of data and advance research across studies. CDEs are data elements that have been identified and defined for use in multiple data sets across different studies. Use of CDEs can facilitate data sharing and standardization to improve data quality and enable data integration from multiple studies and sources, including electronic health records. NIH ICs have identified CDEs for many clinical domains (e.g., neurological disease), types of studies (e.g. genome-wide association studies (GWAS)), types of outcomes (e.g., patient-reported outcomes), and patient registries (e.g., the Global Rare Diseases Patient Registry and Data Repository). NIH has established a Common Data Element (CDE) Resource Portal\" (\n     \n     http://cde.nih.gov/\n     \n    ) to assist investigators in identifying NIH-supported CDEs when developing protocols, case report forms, and other instruments for data collection. The Portal provides guidance about and access to NIH-supported CDE initiatives and other tools and resources for the appropriate use of CDEs and data standards in NIH-funded research. Investigators are encouraged to consult the Portal and describe in their applications any use they will make of NIH-supported CDEs in their projects.\n    \n \n    NIMH expects investigators for this funding announcement to collect Common Data Elements (CDEs) for mental health human subjects research. Unless NIMH stipulates otherwise during the negotiation of the terms and conditions of a grant award, this Notice applies to all grant applications involving human research participants. The necessary funds for collecting and submitting these CDE data from all research participants to the\n     \n     NIMH Data Archive (NDA)\n     \n    should be included in the requested budget. A cost estimator (\n     \n     https://nda.nih.gov/ndarpublicweb/Documents/NDA_Data_Submission_Costs.xlsx\n     \n    ) is available to facilitate the calculation of these costs. NIMH may seek further information regarding CDEs prior to award. Additional information about CDEs can be found at the\n     \n     NIMH webpage on Data Management and Sharing for Applicants and Awardees.\n     \n \n \n \n \n    6. Funding Restrictions\n    \n \n    All NIH awards are subject to the terms and conditions, cost principles, and other considerations described in the\n     \n     NIH Grants Policy Statement\n     \n    .\n    \n \n    Pre-award costs are allowable only as described in the\n     \n     NIH Grants Policy Statement Section 7.9.1 Selected Items of Cost.\n     \n \n \n \n   7. Other Submission Requirements and Information\n    \n    Applications must be submitted electronically following the instructions described in the How to Apply Application Guide. Paper applications will not be accepted.\n    \n \n    Applicants must complete all required registrations before the application due date. Section III.

Application Review Information\n    \n \n \n \n    1. Criteria\n    \n \n    Only the review criteria described below will be considered in the review process. Applications submitted to the NIH in support of the\n     \n     NIH mission\n     \n    are evaluated for scientific and technical merit through the NIH peer review system.\n    \n \n \n \n    For this particular announcement, note the following:\n    \n \n    This NIMH R34 NOFO supports pilot research consistent with NIMH priorities for services research studies that are not immediate precursors to the development and testing of services interventions. Because this NOFO supports exploratory/developmental research, applications need not have extensive background material or preliminary information as one might normally expect in an R01 application. Preliminary data are not required for R34 applications but may be included if available. Adequate justification for the proposed work can be provided through literature citations, data from other sources, or, when available, investigator-generated data. Therefore, reviewers will focus their evaluation on the conceptual framework, the level of innovation, and the potential to significantly advance scientific knowledge or understanding related to mental health services.\n    \n \n \n   Overall Impact\n    \n    Reviewers will provide an overall impact score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood for the project to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the research field(s) involved, in consideration of the following scored review criteria and additional review criteria (as applicable for the project proposed). An application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged likely to have a major scientific impact.\n    \n \n \n   Scored Review Criteria\n    \n    Reviewers will consider Factors 1, 2 and 3 in the determination of scientific merit, and in providing an overall impact score. In addition, Factors 1 and 2 will each receive a separate factor score.\n    \n \n \n \n    Factor 1.

Currently funded IMPROVE investigators, particularly those of the Maternal Health Centers of Excellence, are encouraged to partner with investigators with complementary and integrative health expertise. Eligibility is limited to currently funded investigators of the IMPROVE Initiative. Applications submitted under this NOFO are expected to propose a multi-site feasibility clinical trial that will provide new information that is scientifically necessary for the planning and conduct of a subsequent clinical efficacy or effectiveness study, pragmatic trial, or dissemination and implementation trial on a mind and body intervention to enhance maternal health. It is expected that applications to this NOFO will describe the planned future clinical trial and in so doing demonstrate that the proposed (R01) research is scientifically necessary to design or plan the subsequent fully powered, full-scale clinical trial. Under this R01, the data collected should be used to fill gaps in scientific knowledge, including, but not limited to, the following: assessing whether the intervention can be delivered with fidelity across sites; demonstrating feasibility of recruitment, accrual, and randomization of participants across sites; demonstrating participant adherence to the intervention, as well as retention of participants throughout the study across sites; refining and assessing the feasibility of protocolized multimodal interventions; and/or demonstrating feasibility of data collection across sites in preparation for a future fully powered, multi-site efficacy or effectiveness trial. The need for multi-site feasibility trials is expected to be justified by sufficient preliminary data from previous single-site feasibility or acceptability trial(s) or the published literature.

Notice of Funding Opportunity Description RFA-AT-25-002: Limited Competition: Advancing the Science of Complementary and Integrative Health Approaches to Improve Maternal Health Outcomes (R01 Clinical Trial Required) Section I. Notice of Funding Opportunity Description\n    \n \n \n \n \n     Background\n     \n \n \n    Among high-income countries, the United States has the highest maternal mortality rate. The maternal health crisis disproportionately affects Black/African American and American Indian/Alaskan Native women.\u00a0Disparities also exist by age, education, socioeconomic status, and geographic region. Improving maternal health is a national priority as reflected by the\n     \n     White House Blueprint for Addressing the Maternal Health Crisis\n     \n    . The national focus on the maternal health crisis has resulted in several initiatives by the National Institute of Health (NIH). The NIH Implementing a Maternal Health and PRegnancy Outcome Vision for Everyone (\n     \n     IMPROVE\n     \n    ) Initiative is one such effort, which was launched in 2019 to support research to address the high rates of pregnancy-related complications (i.e., severe maternal morbidity) and deaths (i.e., maternal mortality) in the United States. The IMPROVE effort is a multipronged initiative designed to build the evidence base of maternal health-related solutions for all women to promote maternal health equity.\n    \n \n    The initiative encompasses several integrated components, including the Maternal Health Research Centers of Excellence (CoEs) which utilize innovative approaches to design and conduct research projects in partnership with communities most affected (i.e., populations with health disparities; maternity care deserts) to reduce preventable causes of maternal deaths and improve health for women before, during, and after pregnancy. With support from a Data Innovation and Coordination Hub and the Implementation Science Hub, the research centers share lessons learned, participate in training and research, and disseminate their results. In addition to conducting research projects and building community partnerships, the centers have a robust training and professional development element to grow the maternal health workforce. Although the IMPROVE Maternal Health Centers of Excellence encompass a wide variety of topics and conditions that impact maternal health, complementary and integrative health approaches are not a central feature of the interventions. Complementary and integrative health approaches are widely used by the public, and they are increasingly recognized as a nonpharmacologic approach to symptom management (e.g., chronic pain, mild depression, anxiety). These approaches have been used by individuals to help prevent, treat, or self-manage various conditions before, during, and after pregnancy, and they can be complementary to conventional health care. However, systematic reviews and meta-analyses of these interventions suggest there is a need for more rigorous studies to improve the evidence base of complementary and integrative approaches with physical and/or psychological inputs (often called mind and body interventions) that can inform maternal health clinical practice guidelines.\n    \n \n    Although the scientific literature may provide the rationale for conducting an efficacy or effectiveness trial, investigators may lack critical information about key elements needed to plan and conduct such a trial. Some key aspects that may need further investigation to plan the future clinical trial could include refining or adapting the intervention to specific populations, modalities, or settings; assessing the feasibility, acceptability, and adherence to protocolized interventions; finalizing the intervention delivery method, and determining appropriate outcome(s), or recruitment strategies. Early phase clinical trials supported under this notice of funding opportunity (NOFO) can fill this information gap, thereby improving study design and feasibility. That is, this NOFO will support multi-site feasibility trials that can provide valuable information regarding whether the intervention can be delivered with fidelity by multiple providers across multiple sites; determine feasibility of recruitment, randomization, and retention strategies; and test methods for consistent data collection including follow-up data to minimize missing data\n     \n     .\n     \n    It is expected that multi-site feasibility trials funded by this NOFO will allow investigators to collect preliminary data needed to develop future applications for fully powered efficacy and effectiveness trials of mind and body approaches to promote healthy pregnancies and/or improve maternal health.\n    \n \n \n     Research Objectives of the Mind and Body Multi-Site Feasibility Clinical Trial in Maternal Health (R01)\n     \n \n \n    This limited competition NOFO encourages investigators of the IMPROVE Initiative, particularly the Maternal Health Centers of Excellence, to partner with complementary and integrative health investigators to expand current projects and/or propose new pilot projects to test the multi-site feasibility of utilizing complementary and integrative health approaches with physical and/or psychological therapeutic inputs (often called mind and body interventions) to promote healthy pregnancies and/or enhance maternal health outcomes.\n    \n \n    Applications submitted under this NOFO are expected to propose a multi-site feasibility clinical trial that will facilitate the design and execution of a future fully powered multi-site clinical trial (see examples below). To justify the need for a multi-site feasibility clinical trial, applicants must reference their own single-site feasibility trial preliminary data or extant published data (see preliminary data requirements below). If previous multi-site feasibility trials have been published, are completed, or underway, then further feasibility research may not be needed. Applications proposing such iterative or duplicative studies will be considered of low programmatic relevance. The application should address any remaining gaps in knowledge that are needed before conducting a fully powered, multi-site efficacy, effectiveness, pragmatic, or dissemination and implementation trial. Investigators should consult the NCCIH website (https://www.nccih.nih.gov/grants/pilot-studies-common-uses-and-misuses) for more information on the uses and misuses of feasibility studies.\n    \n \n    For this NOFO, multi-site feasibility clinical trials are defined as trials that enroll research participants from at least two sites that are geographically distinct and non-overlapping with respect to the population of patients engaging with services and are likely to recruit diverse participants. Demonstrating the ability to deliver an intervention with fidelity across sites is critical to demonstrating the ability to later perform a fully powered multi-site efficacy or effectiveness clinical trial. Multiple sites are necessary in efficacy and effectiveness trials to increase the generalizability of the findings, by increasing the size and diversity of eligible participants to enhance recruitment efforts.\n    \n \n    Appropriate goals for multi-site feasibility clinical trials proposed in response to this NOFO include but are not limited to:\n    \n \n \n     Demonstrate feasibility of recruitment rate, randomization, and retention of participants across multiple sites.\n     \n \n     Assess whether the intervention can be delivered with fidelity across sites, and/or assess whether minor intervention adaptation is useful to enhance adherence, outcome selection, and/or fidelity.\n     \n \n     Demonstrate acceptability and/or adherence to a protocolized multi-component intervention across sites.\n     \n \n     Demonstrate feasibility in measuring outcomes within designated time frames, training interventionists, and delivering the intervention with fidelity across sites.\n     \n \n     Demonstrate participant adherence to the intervention throughout the study across sites.\n     \n \n     Demonstrate consistent collection of clinical data, including follow-up data across sites.\n     \n \n     Assess feasibility of strategies for integrating a mind and body approach into multiple health care systems to inform the execution of future pragmatic or implementation research trials.\n     \n \n     Determine appropriate control/comparison conditions for future large-scale study.\n     \n \n \n \n     Design Considerations\n     \n \n \n    Investigators should propose a randomized controlled trial design with at least one intervention arm and one comparator arm. There should be strong rationale for the comparator condition (e.g., time and attention control, usual care, standard of care, sham condition, and/or active comparator[s]) based on the research question you plan to address in the future powered trial. Due to lack of rigor and potential expectancy effects, this NOFO will not support studies proposing a wait list comparator condition.\n    \n \n    The complementary or integrative approaches with physical and/or psychological therapeutic inputs (often called mind and body interventions) should include one or more of the following:\n    \n \n \n     Physical approaches such, but not limited to, as spinal manipulation or mobilization, massage, tai chi, qi gong, yoga, acupuncture;\n     \n \n     Psychological approaches such as, but not limited to, hypnosis, guided imagery, breathing exercises, progressive relaxation, meditation, biofeedback, mindfulness techniques,\u00a0or music or other art-based therapies;\n     \n \n     Multi-component interventions \u00a0that may include the use of natural products such as naturopathic medicine, traditional Chinese medicine, and Ayurvedic medicine, chiropractic care, or a combination of two or more of the specific complementary health approaches (e.g., massage and biofeedback, or yoga and mindfulness); or integrated approaches to care in which a complementary health approach is used in combination with standard care (e.g., mindfulness or yoga as augmentation to conventional medications);\n     \n \n     Multilevel intervention level (patient, caregivers of patient, clinicians, and health care system) where at least one level of intervention includes a mind and body intervention.\n     \n \n \n \n     Power Recommendations\n     \n \n \n    Pilot or feasibility studies are carried out in preparation for future large-scale, adequately powered studies and therefore should address key issues of process (e.g., recruitment, retention, feasibility, adherence, and/or fidelity) and/or outcomes assessment (e.g., feasibility of the method, frequency, burden, and duration of data collection procedures). Given the limited sample sizes that can be supported under this R01 grant mechanism, proposing to conduct fully powered tests of clinical outcomes (i.e., efficacy) or underpowered tests of outcomes (i.e., \"preliminary efficacy\") or attempting to utilize the highly variable point estimate of an effect size for future power calculations of a larger scale study would not be appropriate and are noted as nonresponsive below. As pilot and feasibility studies are not designed (or powered) to address efficacy or effectiveness of an approach or intervention, statistical methods should be mainly descriptive. Applicants should use quantitative benchmarks corresponding to each assessment category in determining trial feasibility. Scientific and/or statistical justification should be provided to demonstrate how the sample size is sufficient to make a feasibility/acceptability determination in accordance with proposed benchmarks. Sample sizes used in pilot studies are not formally powered for testing prespecified hypotheses as conventionally expected for confirmatory studies. Sample sizes for subsequent fully powered studies should be based on an achievable, clinically meaningful improvement due to the intervention in the research population with appropriate power calculations. Investigators should consult the NCCIH website (https://www.nccih.nih.gov/grants/pilot-studies-common-uses-and-misuses) for more information on the uses and misuses of feasibility studies.\n    \n \n \n     Group-Based Interventions\n     \n \n \n    In some cases, investigators who wish to evaluate the effect of an intervention on a health-related biomedical or behavioral outcome may propose a study in which (1) groups or clusters are assigned to study arms, and individual observations are analyzed to evaluate the effect of the intervention, or (2) participants are assigned individually to study arms but receive at least some of their intervention in a real or virtual group or through a shared facilitator. Investigators should provide a strong rationale for the choice among trial design options. The selection of study design should be guided by decisions about how best to deliver the intervention and by concerns regarding contamination and logistics. Applicants should show that their methods are appropriate given their plans for assignment of participants and delivery of interventions. Additional information is available at https://researchmethodsresources.nih.gov/.\n    \n \n \n     Mechanistic Measures\n     \n \n \n    There are often questions about whether feasibility trials should include mechanistic aims to evaluate how interventions work. Trials submitted under this NOFO should not include aims to assess the impact/efficacy of an intervention on a mechanism of action or evaluate mediation effects. Mechanistic measures may be included in multi-site feasibility trials for the purpose of determining if collecting the mechanistic measure is feasible, which can inform whether mediation or moderation aims should be included in a future large-scale efficacy or effectiveness trial. Applications would need to justify why the mechanistic outcome(s) should be included in the future efficacy or effectiveness trial. The inclusion of mechanistic measures should not introduce a significant burden for participants or utilize a significant portion of the budget.\n    \n \n \n     Preliminary Data About the Intervention:\n     \n \n \n    This NOFO is appropriate when there is a clear and compelling rationale, a rigorous empirical basis, and a scientific premise to conduct a multi-site feasibility trial. The following preliminary data from previous studies (preferred from published literature, or the team\u2019s previous research) on a similar intervention, patient population, and age group, as proposed in the current application, are required:\n    \n \n \n     Demonstration that an intervention similar to the one proposed in the trial is well tolerated (does not produce frequent severe adverse events).\n     \n \n     Pilot single-site feasibility data on a similar intervention in a similar clinical population to the proposed trial (e.g., a proposed study to examine yoga in postpartum women with anxiety may cite pilot work on yoga in a population of pregnant women with depression and anxiety).\n     \n \n     Demonstrated adherence (e.g., cite a pilot study of similar duration with sufficient adherence).\n     \n \n     Demonstrated retention of participants for a similar study duration (e.g., cite a pilot study that retained a sufficient percentage of participants at the primary outcome time point).\n     \n \n     Information to justify the delivery mode, duration, frequency of the intervention (achieve and expected clinical benefit). For example, the intervention could be delivered as a single 30-minute session once a week for 8 weeks, or as self-paced 5-minute modules over 10 weeks. Preliminary data should demonstrate that the selected doses are feasible and likely to have the greatest impact on clinical outcome and minimize the risk of adverse events.\n     \n \n \n \n     Preliminary Data about the Research Team:\n     \n \n \n    In addition, all the following information demonstrating the research team\u2019s collective experience conducting clinical trials is required:\n    \n \n \n     Delivered a similar intervention via the same delivery mode in a clinical trial with fidelity.\n     \n \n     Successfully recruited, randomized, and retained similar participants.\n     \n \n     Successfully randomized participants to similar intervention and control conditions.\n     \n \n     Achieved adherence to a similar intervention study protocol by research staff.\n     \n \n     Retained participants for a similar study duration.\n     \n \n     Completed collection of follow-up data with consistency and minimal missing data.\n     \n \n     Published results from previous completed trials.\n     \n \n     For applications studying the feasibility or acceptability of including a natural product as part of a multi-component intervention, the application must provide published data that the formulation of the natural product proposed has demonstrated efficacy for the condition being studied from at least one fully powered placebo-controlled trial.\n     \n \n \n \n     Timeline\n     \n \n \n    Investigators should propose a realistic timeline for the startup and completion of the clinical trial and provide contingency plans to proactively confront potential delays or disturbances to the planned trial.\n    \n \n \n     Institute and Center Specific Areas of Interest\n     \n \n \n \n     National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH)\n     \n \n \n    NCCIH is interested in applications for multi-site feasibility trials that align with the NCCIH Strategic Plan (https://www.nccih.nih.gov/about/strategic-plans-and-reports). Areas of interest include but are not limited to:\n    \n \n    Promotion of health behaviors, health restoration, emotional well-being, or resilience in birthing individuals;\n    \n \n \n     Prevention or treatment of symptoms and disorders, such as, obesity, sleep disorders or disturbances, depression, anxiety, chronic stress, post-traumatic stress (disorder), and acute and chronic pain conditions in birthing individuals;\n     \n \n     Whole person health outcomes including multisystem or multilevel outcomes;\n     \n \n     Minority health and reduction of disparities\n      \n      1\n      \n     in areas such as pain, obesity, mental and emotional behavioral health, and maternal health;\n     \n \n     Assessment of multilevel factors, including social and structural determinants of health (\n      \n      https://www.ninr.nih.gov/researchandfunding/nih-sdohrcc\n      \n     ), which impact implementation of the mind and body intervention;\n     \n \n     Cultural and contextual adaptations of complementary and integrative health approaches to promote healthy pregnancies and enhance maternal health outcomes;\n     \n \n     Novel continuum care models to implement complementary health approaches in conjunction with conventional care therapies to address risk of maternal morbidity and mortality and enhance maternal health outcomes;\n     \n \n     Utilization of mHealth approaches.\n     \n \n \n    When evidence justifies, NCCIH encourages applications to conduct studies in a way that assesses the impact of integrating interventions into relevant settings (e.g., health care systems, Federally qualified health centers, military or veteran health care delivery organizations, community organizations, justice systems, or homeless shelters).\n    \n \n    All NIH-funded research must adhere to the Code of Federal Regulations, which outlines specific requirements to enhance protections for pregnant women, human fetuses, and neonates; children; and prisoners (\n     \n     https://grants.nih.gov/policy/humansubjects/policies-and-regulations/vulnerable-populations.htm\n     \n    l). It is the policy of NIH that individuals of all ages, including children (i.e., individuals under the age of 18) and older adults, must be included in all human subjects research, conducted or supported by NIH, unless there are scientific or ethical reasons not to include them (\n     \n     https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-18-116.html\n     \n    ).\n    \n \n \n     1\n     \n    NIH-designated health disparity populations include racial and ethnic minorities (African Americans/Blacks, Hispanics/Latinos, American Indians/Alaska Natives, Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Other Pacific Islanders), sexual and gender minorities, socioeconomically disadvantaged populations, underserved rural populations, and people with disabilities.\n    \n \n \n     National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD)\n     \n \n \n    The National Institutes of Health (NIH) launched the IMPROVE initiative in 2019 in response to high rates of pregnancy-related complications and deaths, also called maternal morbidity and mortality, in the United States. The NIH Implementing a Maternal health and PRegnancy Outcomes Vision for Everyone (\n     \n     IMPROVE\n     \n    ) Initiative aims to understand the biological, behavioral, environmental, sociocultural, and structural factors that affect pregnancy-related and pregnancy-associated morbidity and mortality and build an evidence base for improved care and outcomes. The initiative supports research to reduce preventable causes of maternal deaths and severe maternal morbidity and improve health for women before, during, and after delivery, particularly for populations disproportionately affected.\n     \n \n \n \n \n     National Institute of mental Health (NIMH)\n     \n \n \n    The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) is interested in supporting applications on pilot hybrid effectiveness implementation research focused on the prevention or treatment of maternal mental health disorders (e.g., depression, anxiety, PTSD) and symptoms (e.g., intrusive thoughts, psychosis). The research supported through this RFA is consistent with NIMH\u2019s priorities for: 1) refining and optimizing preventive and therapeutic mental health interventions with previously demonstrated efficacy for use with broader populations or for delivery routine care, community, or online settings, and 2) research on implementation strategies that support the delivery and sustainability of evidence supported preventive and therapeutic interventions for maternal populations in accessible real-world settings.\n    \n \n    NIMH encourages a deployment-focused model of intervention design and testing that considers the perspective of relevant end-users and the key characteristics of the intervention setting. \u00a0Accordingly, applications to NIMH must propose to pilot a hybrid effectiveness implementation trial design that proposes to simultaneously explore the clinical impact of the intervention and implementation factors or strategies that impact intervention access, engagement, or sustainability.

It is particularly important to include a discussion of how the future trial will test the proposed hypotheses and how or why there is clinical equipoise. The application should clearly state the need for and timeliness of both the future trial and the proposed multi-site feasibility trial, emphasizing how the results will address an evidence gap and therefore advance knowledge of theory and practice in this area. A discussion of the costs and benefits of the future trials should be included for evaluation of the trial's significance.\n    \n \n    The importance of the proposed multi-site feasibility trial should be described and why it is scientifically necessary to plan the subsequent future trial. Discuss how the proposed trial will test the multi-site feasibility hypothesis and how the results of the trial (positive or negative) will guide decisions about whether a subsequent study is feasible, and/or evidence that additional studies must be completed before proceeding to the full-scale trial. Applications should address the reasons for selection of the intervention. This may include public health impact if subsequent efficacy trials are conducted and achieve positive results,\u202fethical dimensions, and patient perspectives on acceptability of the proposed intervention.

Applicants should refer to NIH\u2019s policy on data and safety monitoring (https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-00-038.html), as well as the NCCIH's Guidelines for Data and Safety Monitoring (https://www.nccih.nih.gov/grants/policies/data-and-safety-monitoring-of-nccihfunded-clinical-research). The data and safety monitoring plan must explicitly describe plans to remotely monitor participant safety with appropriate safeguards to minimize risk. The Independent Monitoring Committee (IMC) or Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will have the responsibility to review interim and final data, recommend whether the protocol should be modified, and, at each meeting, recommend whether the study should continue or be terminated early. Thus, its ethical responsibilities to the participants, as well as to the integrity of the study, are of paramount importance to NCCIH. The IMC/DSMB will meet in person or by phone at least twice a year. To avoid conflicts of interest in peer review, applicants should not appoint IMC/DSMB members in advance of peer review, or even inquire about possible DSMB members.\n    \n \n \n \n      Section 4 - Protocol Synopsis\n      \n \n \n \n \n     4.5.

Investigators should describe the process and the associated timeline that will be used to attain all FDA or other applicable regulatory agency approvals necessary to the conduct of the trial. For trials using an FDA-regulated product that requires an IND or IDE application, the grant application must include evidence regarding the outcome of a pre-IND meeting, or other evidence of communication with the FDA. If the protocol is being conducted under a non-U.S. regulatory agency, the applicant should submit a plan for attaining those regulatory approvals. If the protocol is exempt from an IND or IDE, a copy of the exemption letter from the FDA should be provided as part of the PDF file attachment. The FDA has provided guidance indicating that for substances that are Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) that are used in a clinical trial to evaluate the product's ability to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent disease, it may require an IND under part 312 (\n     \n     https://www.fda.gov/media/79386/download\n     \n    ). If the FDA requires an IND application for the proposed clinical trial, the IND application must be submitted to the FDA, with no clinical hold imposed by the FDA before the application is funded.\n    \n \n \n \n      Section 5 - Other Clinical Trial-Related Attachments\n      \n \n \n \n \n     5.1 Other Clinical Trial-Related Attachments\n     \n \n \n    The following attachments must be included as part of the application.

This includes 1) etiologic research that will directly inform intervention development or adaptations, 2) research that develops, adapts, or tests interventions for health promotion, prevention, treatment, or recovery, and 3) where a sufficient body of knowledge on intervention efficacy exists, research on dissemination and implementation that develops and tests strategies to overcome barriers to the adoption, integration, scale-up, and sustainability of effective interventions. Through this initiative, intervention and related research is sought to build upon community knowledge, resources, and resilience to identify and rigorously test culturally appropriate solutions to reduce morbidity and mortality.\u00a0Interventions should be designed with a consideration for sustainability within the communities where they are tested, and have the flexibility to be readily adapted, disseminated, and scaled up to other communities where culturally appropriate. This NOFO is part of the\u00a0Intervention Research to Improve Native American Health (IRINAH) initiative, which also includes NOFOs using the R21 Exploratory/Developmental Research Grant mechanism (\n     \n     PAR-25-380\n     \n    ) and the R34 Clinical Trial Planning Grant mechanism (\n     \n     PAR-25-378\n     \n    ). Research projects may address topics within the identified interests of any of the participating Institutes or Centers; projects are not limited to substance use and addiction research.\n    \n \n    For the purposes of this NOFO, Native Americans include the following populations: Alaska Natives, American Indians (whose ancestral lands fall at least partially within the U.S. mainland border), and Native Hawaiians. The term \u2018Native Hawaiian\u2019 means any individual any of whose ancestors were natives, prior to 1778, of the area which now comprises the State of Hawaii.\n    \n \n \n   Funding Opportunity Goal(s)\n    \n    NIH\u2019s mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability.\n    \n This variable defines that we need to start a new row.", "98d54546-23c8-4a72-8492-1387886a51af": "PAR-25-379: Intervention Research to Improve Native American Health (R01 Clinical Trial Optional) Key Dates PAR-25-379: Intervention Research to Improve Native American Health (R01 Clinical Trial Optional) Key Dates\n    \n \n \n   Posted Date\n   January 21, 2025\n    \n \n   Open Date (Earliest Submission Date)\n   September 21, 2025\n    \n \n   Letter of Intent Due Date(s)\n    \n    Not Applicable\n    \n This variable defines that we need to start a new row.  \n \n \n   The following table includes NIH\n    \n    standard due dates\n    \n   marked with an asterisk.\n    \n \n \n \n       Application Due Dates\n       \n \n       Review and Award Cycles\n       \n \n \n \n       New\n       \n \n       Renewal / Resubmission / Revision (as allowed)\n       \n \n       AIDS - New/Renewal/Resubmission/Revision, as allowed\n       \n \n       Scientific Merit Review\n       \n \n       Advisory Council Review\n       \n \n       Earliest Start Date\n       \n \n \n \n \n \n       October 21, 2025\n       \n \n       October 21, 2025\n       \n \n       January 07, 2026 *\n       \n \n       March 2026\n       \n \n       May 2026\n       \n \n       July 2026\n       \n \n \n \n       October 21, 2026\n       \n \n       October 21, 2026\n       \n \n       January 07, 2027 *\n       \n \n       March 2027\n       \n \n       May 2027\n       \n \n       July 2027\n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    All applications are due by 5:00 PM local time of applicant organization.\n    \n \n    Applicants are encouraged to apply early to allow adequate time to make any corrections to errors found in the application during the submission process by the due date.\n    \n \n \n   Expiration Date\n   January 08, 2027\n    \n \n   Due Dates for E.O. 12372\n    \n    Not Applicable\n    \n This variable defines that we need to start a new row.  \n \n \n   Required Application Instructions\n    \n    It is critical that applicants follow the instructions in the Research (R) Instructions in the\n     \n     How to Apply - Application Guide\n     \n    , except where instructed to do otherwise (in this NOFO or in a Notice from\n     \n     NIH Guide for Grants and Contracts\n     \n    ).\n    \n \n    Conformance to all requirements (both in the Application Guide and the NOFO) is required and strictly enforced.

Notice of Funding Opportunity Description PAR-25-379: Intervention Research to Improve Native American Health (R01 Clinical Trial Optional) Section I. Notice of Funding Opportunity Description\n    \n \n \n \n    Purpose\n    \n \n    The purpose of this\u00a0notice of funding opportunity (NOFO)\u00a0is to support research on interventions to improve health in Native American populations. This includes 1) etiologic research that will directly inform intervention development or adaptations, 2) research that develops, adapts, or tests interventions for health promotion, prevention, treatment, or recovery, and 3) where a sufficient body of knowledge on intervention efficacy exists, research on dissemination and implementation that develops and tests strategies to overcome barriers to the adoption, integration, scale-up, and sustainability of effective interventions. Through this initiative, intervention and related research is sought to build upon community knowledge, resources, and resilience to identify and rigorously test culturally appropriate solutions to reduce morbidity and mortality. Research projects may address topics within the identified interests of any of the participating Institutes or Centers.\u00a0The inclusion of Native American investigators serving on the study teams or as the PD(s)/PI(s) is strongly encouraged.\n    \n \n    For the purposes of this NOFO, Native Americans include the following populations: Alaska Natives, American Indians (whose ancestral lands fall at least partially within the U.S. mainland border), and Native Hawaiians. The term \u2018Native Hawaiian\u2019 means any individual any of whose ancestors were natives, prior to 1778, of the area, which now comprises the State of Hawaii.\n    \n \n    Background\n    \n \n    Despite tremendous strengths, Native Americans have highly disparate rates of disease across many health outcomes such as chronic disease, substance use and addiction, cancer, mental illness, and sexually transmitted diseases. These disease outcomes in many cases can be traced to socio-structural factors and social and environmental determinants of health such as poverty, unemployment, pollution, and poor access to health care in combination with unique factors impacting Native people, such as historical trauma. In the face of these structural challenges, resiliencies and strengths within Native communities and individuals have been drawn upon to improve health outcomes.\n    \n \n    There is a significant need for research that identifies malleable targets for intervention, tests the impact of new or existing intervention approaches, and identifies best practices for dissemination and implementation of effective interventions. Interventions that are theoretically grounded and built upon Indigenous Knowledge (see:\n     \n     https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/ostps-teams/climate-and-environment/indigenous-knowledge/\n     \n    ) and empirical evidence are needed to promote health, to prevent and treat disease, and to support recovery. Given continued disparities in service access and quality, and in disease outcomes, additional efforts are needed to advance dissemination and implementation science relevant to Native communities. There is a need for research to identify, understand, and develop strategies for overcoming barriers to the adoption, adaptation, integration, scale-up, and sustainability of evidence-based interventions, tools, policies, and guidelines that support the health of Native populations.\n    \n \n    Projects proposed should 1) Clearly identify a health or disease condition for which there is need for intervention and community support and engagement to address the problem, 2) Articulate a process for ensuring cultural appropriateness and/or recognition of community strengths and resiliencies, 3) Advance knowledge toward addressing the health or disease condition through etiologic research, prevention research, treatment or recovery research or dissemination and implementation research, and 4) Be designed for sustainability in the test communities and for dissemination and scale up to other communities as indicated. Interventions may address individual behaviors, social conditions, or environmental conditions related to a disease or disorder.\n    \n \n    Research should be designed in such a way that there is a high probability that interventions delivered can be scaled and sustained if the intervention is found to be effective. To ensure sustainability of intervention designs and service delivery strategies tested, applicants should, whenever possible, partner with tribes/communities and localities that use existing programming funds (e.g., funding from CDC, SAMHSA, Indian Health Services, Medicaid, Medicare and other insurance providers, and other program funding as appropriate) to support evidence-based programs and leverage those resources as the foundation for building infrastructure.\n    \n \n    Qualitative data (structured, semi-structured, open-ended, and observational) can be particularly useful for understanding unique factors related to risk and resilience processes, for refining interventions and measures, for interpreting intervention research findings, and for understanding challenges in dissemination and implementation of effective strategies. Qualitative research is also helpful for assessing community or tribal-level approval and commitment. Applicants may choose to incorporate qualitative or mixed-methods approaches, including talking circles, interviews, focus groups, or other methods.\n    \n \n    This NOFO is part of the\n     \n     Intervention Research to Improve Native American Health (IRINAH) initiative\n     \n    (see:\n     \n     https://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/native-american-intervention\n     \n    ). The initiative also includes\n     \n     PAR-25-380\n     \n    , which uses the Exploratory/Developmental Grant (R21) mechanism and covers similar scientific scope to this one and\n     \n     PAR-25-378\n     \n    , which uses the Clinical Trial Planning Grant (R34) mechanism and is specifically scoped to support researchers for community-engaged intervention development and feasibility testing.\n     \n     PAR-25-378\n     \n    may also be used for the development and piloting of protocols for future tests of intervention efficacy, effectiveness, or implementation.\n     \n     Not all NIH Institutes and Centers (ICs) participate in all three NOFOs\n     \n    . Please speak with the Scientific Contact for the IC listed in Section VII below for the IC you wish to target to discuss which NOFO might be the best fit for your proposed project.\n    \n \n \n     Additional Considerations for Proposed Research\n     \n \n \n    Applicants are encouraged to consult\n     \n     American Indian and Alaska Native Research in the Health Sciences: Critical Considerations for the Review of Research Applications,\n     \n    which can be found at\n     \n \n \n     https://dpcpsi.nih.gov/sites/default/files/Critical_Considerations_for_Reviewing_AIAN_Research_508.pdf\n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     Coordination across projects\n     \n    . Although the studies supported by the IRINAH initiative will not use a common study protocol, investigators are expected to meet regularly as part of a network to participate in activities in support of advancing research on Native American health. Such activities could include participating in cross-cutting interest groups, sharing and discussion of measures, and developing collaborative publications and products. An annual meeting will be held of all investigators with optional attendance by community partners funded by the IRINAH initiative; monthly or bi-monthly phone calls will also be held. Locations of the annual meeting will vary depending on sites funded through the initiative. Project budgets should include costs for one or more study team members to attend the annual meeting.\n    \n \n \n     Etiology Research.\n     \n    In describing research priorities, the National Congress of American Indians has stated that research must benefit Native people. This means that the research should have tangible benefits by informing strategies for increasing health equity or otherwise provide information that can be used by the community to make improvements. As such, the etiology research supported by this NOFO should have clear implications for improving the ability to intervene. Etiology research should only be proposed when it is intended to discover a more basic understanding or add nuanced clarification, which would be helpful in designing efficacious interventions.\n    \n \n \n     Conceptions of Health.\n     \n    While the absence of a particular disease is a critical outcome, the concept of health within many Native American communities embodies wellness and is broader than the absence of disease. All four elements of life \u2014 physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual \u2014 are intricately woven\u00a0together and interact to support a strong and healthy person. In this holistic perspective, illness results from imbalance and wellness from balance in these elements. For Native people who identify strongly with tribal or indigenous culture, working with traditional healers or engaging in traditional cultural practices may be a first step taken to address disease or improve wellness. For this announcement, investigators are encouraged to consider Native concepts of health and Native practices in the study of etiology, prevention, and treatment.\n    \n \n \n     Community Engagement.\n     \n    The appropriate conduct of research with Native American populations has been widely documented; research must be conducted in a community-engaged manner, where the community has an equal voice as a research partner. The research should be consistent with community desires and informed by these at every step of the process. Community based participatory research (CBPR) approaches are one way to ensure appropriate engagement with communities in research and the cultural appropriateness of the intervention, study design and overall approach. Where communities desire to do so, researchers should incorporate a CBPR approach. Communities may choose to pursue approaches other than CBPR, and other forms of community-engaged research are acceptable for this NOFO. The community/tribe(s) must be appropriately involved in the study design and overall approach.\n    \n \n \n     Culturally Appropriate\u00a0Research.\n     \n    Native communities and experts on Native American research have made clear the importance of culture in addressing health outcomes. Investigators are encouraged to consider culturally unique etiological factors or targets for intervention, relying on culturally relevant theories to frame research, considering culturally specific world views and Indigenous Knowledge as they relate to the research approach and design, culturally sensitive research processes, and culturally appropriate measurement strategies and processes.\n    \n \n \n     Strength-Based Focus.\n     \n    Since many communities place a high value on the strengths and resilience of Native peoples, investigators are encouraged to\u00a0incorporate community/cultural strengths and resiliencies interventions. It is appropriate to consider community resilience in addition to the resilience of individuals.\n    \n \n \n     Interventions.\n     \n    When studies involve prevention, treatment, or recovery interventions, the interventions must be consistent with community values. Interventions should be supported by theory or empirical knowledge, which can originate from Indigenous Knowledge or from culturally appropriate non-Native paradigms. Intervention studies may test traditional health, medical, and/or cultural practices independent of or in concert with practices that have been tested in research with non-Native populations. Intervention delivery should, whenever possible and scientifically or otherwise appropriate, employ individuals from the community. Such interventionists could include behavioral professionals, community health workers, counselors, nutritionists, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, or traditional healers. The IRINAH initiative aims to strengthen health across multiple Native populations. Applicants should plan to prepare intervention manuals and other potential dissemination activities if evidence for the intervention\u2019s effectiveness is compelling.\n    \n \n \n     Beyond the Individual.\n     \n    Reflecting the importance of community, researchers should consider proposing studies that address community, institutional, familial, peer network, or other factors that directly influence health outcomes or that impact individual's abilities to enact health preserving practices. This could include testing multi-level intervention approaches or addressing and reporting on changes in known contextual influences while intervening to create individual level change. However, the interventions should not be so intensive or time-consuming that they would exceed the resources of the participants/community to participate or sustain the intervention.

Applicants should clearly articulate how their research builds fundamental knowledge relevant to Native American health. NIH\u2019s mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and to use that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability. Through this initiative, fundamental knowledge includes findings that may be specific to a Native American community or group of communities, even if the outcomes may not generalize broadly. Fundamental knowledge may also be defined as principles for community engaged research, or methodological innovations.\n    \n \n    Applicants must demonstrate innovation in their proposed research. Some examples of the types of innovations that may be included are the use of Indigenous Knowledge (\n     \n     https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/ostps-teams/climate-and-environment/indigenous-knowledge/\n     \n    ), research capacity development, novel research design and analysis, novel approaches to community engagement and/or participant recruitment, research to address the cultural appropriateness of standard measures or develop new measures, determination of culturally/clinically meaningful effect sizes, or through the development or adaptation of interventions.\n    \n \n \n     Investigators\n     \n \n \n    Investigators, both those from research institutions and those who work with the community, must show relevant proficiency to conduct the proposed research, including proficiency for working with Native American partners and communities. Indications of proficiency might include research publications, efforts to build relationships and trust with communities, dissemination of information to Native American communities, personal engagement in community events, provision of training to communities, knowledge of community systems and settings, and leadership roles in the community. Productivity of community-based investigators may rely on a description of their proficiency in working within the community.\n    \n \n \n     Partnerships and collaborations\n     \n \n \n    The community-researcher partnership must be documented in the Research Strategy section to describe the community's support for and involvement in development, design, testing, and dissemination of the study, including establishing a Community Advisory Board. If using CBPR research methods, these must be appropriately documented. The description of the community-research organization partnership must describe the scientific, logistic, and organizational responsibilities of each of the collaborators for each aspect of the proposed project. The application should also describe the history of the partners in collaborating on prior research projects, or other mutually beneficial activities, the mutual understanding and cooperation among the partners, procedures for resolving disagreements, and the relative contributions to the previous and current projects.\n    \n \n \n     Approach\n     \n \n \n    Given that prior research within Native communities is often limited, pilot/preliminary data from the community under study are not required. However, applicants are encouraged to provide such data if they are available. If not, applicants are encouraged to provide data on similar interventions that have been conducted in comparable populations or settings. Sources reflecting local knowledge that are not peer-reviewed or that are unpublished are acceptable when justified.\n    \n \n    Whether or not preliminary data are included, the research is expected to be informed by a well-defined theory of change, logic model, or cultural source and associated hypotheses are expected. Research questions that have been addressed for other populations may still need to be specifically addressed for Native Americans if there is reason to believe that processes might operate differently for a Native American community or Native Americans more broadly. Appropriate justifications of scientific gaps areas must be provided in the applications, including, for example, the cultural adaptation of interventions or measures that have been used or validated with other populations. Justifications for the premise of the research can be established based on documentation from scientific and/or cultural sources.\n    \n \n    Applicants must provide evidence of community support and of the feasibility of the planned research. As appropriate to the proposed project, applicants should provide evidence of their ability to recruit participants in each community involved in the study, to implement measurement and intervention protocols in the target population, to provide appropriate oversight, and to maintain high rates of retention throughout the intervention and follow-up period. Applicants should include a discussion of the study team\u2019s prior experience working with the study population, and with the measures and methods to be used or tested in the research.\n    \n \n    When the research involves intervention development, adaptation, or testing, the intervention (or the process of its initial development) must be described, including the theoretical and empirical evidence informing the intervention, the proposed mechanisms of action of the intervention, the health outcomes the intervention is meant to impact, and any relevant protective factors or risk factors that the intervention acts on or through for its hypothesized effects. When appropriate, the study should include plans for assessing fidelity of intervention and/or protocol implementation and/or plans for manualization or other standardization practices. The application must describe how the approach taken will support the future sustainability of the intervention, and any implications for implementing or disseminating the intervention if it is found to be effective in the future trial.\n    \n \n    For intervention testing, the application should describe and scientifically justify the nature of any comparison/control group (e.g., whether the comparison group will receive information only, minimal treatment, delayed intervention, or some other design). Applicants should consult with collaborating communities to discuss the appropriateness of the selected approach to the comparison group, as tribal leaders and community members may believe that comparison group members should receive something more than usual care. The study design, whether a randomized controlled trial or another type of design should be scientifically rigorous and well-justified.\n    \n \n    Evidence of the expertise of the study team to analyze the data from the proposed design must be provided. Applications should address the appropriateness of the measures for the planned study sample and their psychometrics and/or validity. While many research measures have not been validated for Native people, they may be the only measures validated to assess constructs and thus may be an appropriate tool. Research projects may use existing measures or propose research to develop new measures that reflect culturally relevant constructs. The analytic plan should address the strengths and the limitations of the study design and/or datasets used, as well as issues such as missing data, Power estimation should consider both main effects and mediated effects when relevant and should consider clinically meaningful effect sizes. When a mixed-methods approach is proposed, applicants should describe the methods by which the qualitative and quantitative data will be integrated.\n    \n \n \n     Letters of Support:\n     \n \n \n    Provide all appropriate letters of support, including those from community partners, collaborators, tribal resolutions, and others. Letters of support should describe the scientific, logistic, and organizational responsibilities of each of the collaborators for each aspect of the proposed project. The letter(s) of support should also describe the history of the partners in collaborating on prior research projects or other mutually beneficial activities, the mutual understanding and cooperation among the partners, and the relative contributions to the previous projects.\n    \n \n \n     Each Native American organization that participates in the project should submit a letter of support.\n     \n \n     Applications that represent a partnership between a research organization and one or more a tribes or communities should include a resolution from each tribal or community government or equivalent document, specifying that the community or tribe agrees to participate as a partner in the project and will strongly support the project for its entire duration.\n     \n \n     If the application includes a consortium of tribes or communities, applicants should provide a resolution of support from each tribe or community of the consortium.\n     \n \n     If the applicant is a tribally sanctioned non-profit tribal organization, specific tribal resolution(s) of support will not be required if the current tribal resolution(s) under which the organization operates encompasses activities proposed in the application. A copy of the current operational resolution(s) must be submitted with the application.\n     \n \n     In recognizing that Tribal governments are legal sovereign nations, potential partners should be informed that tribes may seek ownership or control of all data and all biological samples; therefore, universities and other partners should be prepared to negotiate data sharing and biological sample sharing agreements with tribes/Tribal government(s) as appropriate. If such an agreement is in place the applicant(s) should provide the letter of such an agreement with the application. Letters of Support should also explicitly stipulate that Tribes agree to respond expeditiously to requests for approval of the protocol, protocol modifications, approval of abstracts for presentation to scientific meetings, and approval of manuscripts for submission for publication in scientific journals. The time required for approving each of these (protocol, abstracts, manuscripts): 1) must be proposed and stated within the resolution of support, 2) may differ for each of these activities, 3) may be modified by study investigators only in consultation with the tribal/community leadership, and 4) should identify an individual or entity within the tribe or community to whom a request for waiver of the time requirement can be directed if circumstances arise. PD/PI(s) and tribes/communities are expected to publish scientific papers, present at scientific conferences/associations/meetings; and may also be expected to develop fact sheets/materials for dissemination to the tribe/community.\n     \n \n \n    If the applicant(s) is working with communities, tribes/tribal governments then community/tribal resolutions of support, or equivalent documents, should accompany the application whenever possible. However, tribal resolutions and letters of support from community collaborators may be submitted as post-submission material up to 30 days before the study section meeting. The date of the study section meeting will be posted in eRA after submission.\n     \n     Note that this flexibility is NOT\u00a0extended to letters of support from Key Personnel and consultants with academic or research organization affiliations.\n     \n    Letters of support from personnel with academic or research organization affiliations must be submitted with the application (on either October due date for non-AIDs applications or the January due date for AIDs applications listed in the Key Dates table above).\n    \n \n \n \n \n     Resource Sharing Plan:\n     \n    Individuals are required to comply with the instructions for the Resource Sharing Plans as provided in the How to Apply- Application Guide.\n    \n \n \n \n \n     Other Plan(s):\n     \n \n \n    All instructions in the How to Apply-Application Guide must be followed, with the following additional instructions:\n    \n \n \n \n \n     All applicants planning research (funded or conducted in whole or in part by NIH) that results in the generation of scientific data are required to comply with the instructions for the Data Management and Sharing Plan.
