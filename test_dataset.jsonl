Proposed research may address health promotion, disease prevention, treatment, recovery, or services research to inform intervention implementation and dissemination.

Notice of Funding Opportunity Description PAR-25-378: Intervention Research to Improve Native American Health (R34 Clinical Trial Optional) Section I. Notice of Funding Opportunity Description\n    \n \n \n \n    Purpose\n    \n \n    The purpose of this\u00a0notice of funding opportunity (NOFO) is to support planning and development, including pilot or feasibility research, in advance of a clinical trial testing interventions to improve health in Native American populations. Proposed research may address health promotion, disease prevention, treatment, recovery, or services research to inform intervention implementation and dissemination.  Although the scientific literature or preliminary data may provide the rationale for conducting a clinical trial, investigators often lack critical information about the study population, recruitment challenges, intervention feasibility and acceptability, outcome measures, data and statistical challenges or operational risks necessary to finalize the trial protocol completely.\n    Native American populations experience unique sociopolitical, historical, and environmental stressors and risks that may exacerbate health conditions and/or impact the effectiveness of existing solutions to address the conditions. They also possess unique strengths and resiliencies that can mitigate stressors and inform intervention strategies.  Research with Native American populations requires engagement with tribal partners and communities to develop or adapt interventions and evaluate them with clinical trial protocols that are rigorous and culturally appropriate.\n    Preparatory studies may fill information gaps, address unknowns, allow for strengthening of tribal partnerships, and pilot test the feasibility of the intervention and clinical trial design, thereby improving scientific rigor and cultural appropriateness of the future clinical trial. Research projects may address topics within the identified interests of any of the participating Institutes or Centers. The inclusion of Native American investigators serving on the study team or as the PD(s)/PI(s) is strongly encouraged.\n    \n \n    For the purposes of this NOFO, Native Americans include the following populations: Alaska Natives (AN), American Indians (AI); whose ancestral lands fall at least partially within the U.S. mainland border), and Native Hawaiians. The term \u2018Native Hawaiian\u2019 means any individual any of whose ancestors were natives, prior to 1778, of the area which now comprises the State of Hawaii.\n    \n \n    Background\n    \n \n    Despite tremendous strengths, Native Americans have highly disparate rates of disease across many health outcomes such as chronic disease, substance use and addiction, cancer, mental illness, and sexually transmitted diseases.\u00a0These disease outcomes in many cases can be traced to socio-structural factors and social and environmental determinants of health such as poverty, unemployment, pollution, and poor access to health care in combination with unique factors impacting Native people, such as historical trauma. In the face of these structural challenges, resiliencies and strengths within Native communities and individuals have been drawn upon to improve health outcomes.\n    \n \n    A critical step towards ensuring scalable and sustainable interventions to reduce the health disparities impacting Native American communities is the development of scientifically rigorous and culturally appropriate clinical trials to test intervention efficacy, effectiveness, and implementation. Active and meaningful engagement of tribal communities and tribal leadership is essential to successful intervention development, adaptation, testing, implementation, and dissemination and to accelerate\u00a0the translation of findings generated by the proposed research into practice. To this end, this R34 NOFO supports\u00a0 planning studies to strengthen community and tribal partnerships, develop and adapt interventions, collect intervention feasibility and acceptability data, test recruitment and retention strategies, and/or address clinical trial study design questions. Studies under this R34 planning grant are intended to address issues that will prepare the future clinical trial protocol for successful implementation and completion and facilitate rigorous full-scale testing of promising interventions to improve Native American health. Applicants must include specific milestones and/or study targets that, if met, will indicate readiness to conduct the planned future intervention efficacy, effectiveness, or implementation trial.\n    \n \n    This NOFO is part of the\n     \n     Intervention Research to Improve Native American Health (IRINAH) initiative\n     \n    (see:\n     \n     https://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/native-american-intervention\n     \n    ). The initiative also includes\n     \n     PAR-25-379\n     \n    , which uses the R01 Research Project Grant mechanism and\n     \n     PAR-25-380\n     \n    which uses the R21 Exploratory/Developmental Grant mechanism.\n     \n     PAR-25-379\n     \n    and\n     \n     PAR-25-380\n     \n    have broader scope than this NOFO.\n     \n     Not all NIH Institutes and Centers (ICs) participate in all three NOFOs\n     \n    . Please speak with the Scientific Contact for the IC listed in Section VII below for the IC you wish to target to discuss which NOFO might be the best fit for your proposed project.\n    \n \n    Scope\n    \n \n    The activities proposed will depend on the stage of intervention development, the delivery setting, and the type of future trial proposed (e.g., efficacy, effectiveness, or implementation). Pilot tests of feasibility and acceptability of the intervention and/or future trial protocol are within scope of this NOFO.\n    \n \n    Research should be designed in such a way that there is a high probability that interventions delivered can be scaled and sustained if the future trial finds the intervention to be effective. To ensure sustainability of intervention designs and service delivery strategies tested, applicants should, whenever possible, partner with tribes/communities and localities that use existing programming funds (e.g., funding from CDC, SAMHSA, Indian Health Services, Medicaid, Medicare and other insurance providers, and other program funding as appropriate) to support evidence-based programs and leverage those resources as the foundation for building infrastructure.\n    \n \n    Examples of appropriate research activities include the following, but this list is not intended to be exhaustive:\n    \n \n \n     Activities to\u00a0further develop and establish meaningful and trusted partnerships\u00a0with Native communities.\n     \n \n     Develop culturally grounded study designs in collaboration with Native American community partners to ensure acceptability and feasibility in Native communities, including developing and/or selecting an intervention, defining the appropriate study population, outcome, study endpoint, and control or comparison group to use in the subsequent efficacy, effectiveness, or implementation trial.\n     \n \n     Determine the acceptability and feasibility of the intervention for study participants, Native American communities, and tribal partners, including standardization across sites and measures of intervention fidelity when appropriate.\n     \n \n     Adapt, standardize, and/or validate an intervention or assessment originally designed for non-Native populations for Native populations.\n     \n \n     Develop a novel intervention grounded in Indigenous Knowledge\u00a0(see:\n      \n      https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/ostps-teams/climate-and-environment/indigenous-knowledge\n      \n     /), empirical and/or theoretical evidence, and/or adapt or standardize an intervention currently used in Native American communities to plan for a future efficacy or effectiveness trial.\n     \n \n     Develop inclusive and culturally appropriate recruitment and retention strategies that engage Native communities.\n     \n \n     Develop culturally informed study protocols, data and safety monitoring plans, analytical plans, and data management and sharing plans.\n     \n \n     Standardize and test the effectiveness of training tools for implementation of the intervention or clinical trial protocol.\n     \n \n     Employ qualitative methods, including talking circles, interviews, or focus groups as needed to address study aims and the development, testing and validation of quantitative survey tools. Qualitative or mixed methods research may also be helpful to assess community or tribal approval and commitment and to contextualize quantitative research findings as appropriate.\n     \n \n     Planning activities to assess the potential feasibility and acceptability of implementation strategies to be utilized in a future implementation research trial in Native American communities, including planning for hybrid effectiveness implementation studies.\n     \n \n \n \n     This R34 NOFO will not support research testing intervention efficacy or effectiveness.\n     \n    Efficacy or effectiveness research could be submitted to the companion IRINAH NOFOs (\n     \n     PAR-25-379\n     \n    and\n     \n     PAR-25-380\n     \n    ).\n    \n \n    Preliminary data are not required for this NOFO.\n    \n \n    Applications Not Responsive to this NOFO\n    \n \n    The following types of studies are not responsive to this NOFO and will not be reviewed:\n    \n \n \n     Applications that do not include an intervention or proposal to develop an intervention within the award period\n     \n \n     Applications that propose efficacy or effectiveness testing of an intervention\n     \n \n     Applications that only propose to write a protocol or manual\n     \n \n     Applications that propose research objectives that are not aligned with the mission of any of the participating ICs\n     \n \n     Applications that do not propose community-engaged projects\n     \n \n     Applications that do not propose research with Native Americans\n     \n \n \n \n     Additional Considerations for Proposed Research\n     \n \n \n    Applicants are encouraged to consult\n     \n     American Indian and Alaska Native Research in the Health Sciences: Critical Considerations for the Review of Research Applications,\n     \n    which can be found at\n     \n \n \n     https://dpcpsi.nih.gov/sites/default/files/Critical_Considerations_for_Reviewing_AIAN_Research_508.pdf\n     \n \n \n \n     Coordination across projects\n     \n    . Although the studies supported by the IRINAH initiative will not use a common study protocol, investigators are expected to meet regularly to participate in activities in support of advancing research on Native American Health. Such activities could include participating in cross-cutting interest groups, sharing and discussion of measures, and developing collaborative publications and products. An annual meeting will be held of all investigators with optional attendance by community partners funded by the IRINAH initiative; monthly or bi-monthly phone calls will also be held. Locations of the annual meeting will vary depending on sites funded through the initiative. Project budgets should include costs for one or more study team members to attend the annual meeting.\n    \n \n \n     Conceptions of Health.\n     \n    While the absence of a particular disease is a critical outcome, the concept of health within many Native American communities embodies wellness and is broader than the absence of disease. All four elements of life \u2014 physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual \u2014 are intricately woven together and interact to support a strong and healthy person. In this holistic perspective, illness results from imbalance and wellness from balance in these elements. For Native people who identify strongly with tribal or indigenous culture, working with traditional healers or engaging in traditional cultural practices may be a core strategy to address disease or improve wellness. For this NOFO, investigators are encouraged to consider Native concepts of health and Native traditional practices as appropriate and approved by the community.\n    \n \n \n     Community Engagement.\n     \n    The appropriate conduct of research with Native American populations has been widely documented; research must be conducted in a community-engaged manner, where the community has an equal voice as a research partner. The research should be consistent with community desires and informed by these at every step of the process. Community based participatory research (CBPR) approaches are one way to ensure appropriate engagement with communities in research and the cultural appropriateness of the intervention, study design and overall approach. Where communities desire to do so, researchers should incorporate a CBPR approach. Communities may choose to pursue approaches other than CBPR, and other forms of community-engaged research are acceptable for this NOFO. The community/tribe(s) must be appropriately involved in the study design and overall approach.\n    \n \n \n     Culturally Appropriate\u00a0Research and Preparatory Activities.\n     \n    Native communities and experts on Native American research have made clear the importance of culture in addressing health outcomes. Investigators are encouraged to consider culturally unique etiological factors or targets for intervention, relying on culturally relevant theories to frame research, considering culturally specific world views and Indigenous Knowledge as they relate to the research approach and design, culturally sensitive research processes, and culturally appropriate measurement strategies and processes.\n    \n \n \n     Strength-Based Focus.\n     \n    Since many communities place a high value on the strengths and resilience of Native peoples, investigators are encouraged to\u00a0incorporate community/cultural strengths and resilience. It is appropriate to consider community resilience in addition to the resilience of individuals.\n    \n \n \n     Interventions.\n     \n    Interventions must be consistent with community cultural values, and be supported by theory or empirical knowledge, which can originate from Indigenous Knowledge or from culturally appropriate non-Native paradigms. Interventions may include traditional health, medical, and/or cultural practices independent of or in concert with practices that have been tested in research with non-Native populations. Intervention delivery should, whenever possible and scientifically or otherwise appropriate, employ individuals from the community. Such interventionists could include behavioral professionals, community health workers, counselors, nutritionists, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, or traditional healers.\n    \n \n \n     Beyond the Individual\n     \n    Reflecting the importance of community and relations, researchers should consider proposing studies that address community, institutional, familial, peer network, or other factors that directly influence health outcomes or that impact individual's abilities to enact health preserving practices. This could include multi-level intervention approaches or addressing and reporting on changes in known contextual influences while intervening to create individual level change. However, the interventions should not be so intensive or time-consuming that they would exceed the resources of the participants/community to participate or affect sustainability. Please see the NIMHD Minority Health and Health Disparities Research Framework as one example (\n     \n     https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/about/overview/research-framework/\n     \n    ).\n    \n \n \n     Future Clinical Trial Design Considerations:\n     \n    Investigators are encouraged to work with Tribal partners and communities to identify potential research designs that will provide robust evidence of intervention efficacy or effectiveness in the future clinical trial.\u00a0Rigorous research designs are expected, but investigators are not required to conduct randomized controlled trials in the future trial.\u00a0and to ensure that they have appropriate statistical expertise on the study team to address any non-independence or other potential sources of bias in the study design.\n    \n \n    If participants are assigned to study arms for the future trial, other potentially appropriate study designs with randomization include parallel group or cluster-randomized trials, individually randomized group-treatment trials, and stepped wedge group or cluster-randomized trials. When it is not possible to assign participants to study arms for the future trial, alternative rigorous research designs that provide robust evidence of intervention effectiveness include, but are not limited to, multiple baseline or repeated measures designs, interrupted time series studies, or stepped-wedge cluster randomized trials in which all subjects receive the intervention.\n    \n \n    In these studies, special methods may be warranted for analysis and sample size estimation, particularly for small samples where traditional experimental randomization is not possible without impacts on bias or contamination. Planning activities proposed under this NOFO may include working to incorporate such methods into the clinical trial protocol\u00a0and research design.\n    \n \n    Research Objectives\n    \n \n    Participating NIH ICs have identified priority research areas below. Applicants are encouraged to speak with IC representatives for technical assistance (see Agency Contacts in Section VII).\u00a0Applicant organizations with limited research experience are strongly encouraged to develop applications in collaboration with research organizations.\n    \n \n \n     Applicants should ensure that the IC they wish to target participates in the IRINAH NOFO to which they wish to submit. Applications that do not align with the missions of any of the participating ICs will be considered non-repsonsive.\n     \n \n \n \n     National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)\n     \n \n \n    The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) is interested in culturally appropriate prevention, treatment, recovery, implementation, and dissemination research focused on substance use among Native adolescents and adults. NIDA is interested in a wide array of substances including but not limited to nicotine, psychostimulants/methamphetamines, opioids, cannabis, synthetic drugs, and psychoactive prescription drugs. Research at the intersection of HIV and substance use, including research that incorporates HIV prevention and/or care, also is welcome.\u00a0Investigators are encouraged to propose research in urban, rural, and reservation settings and research that utilizes existing infrastructure, community resources, service systems (public and private), and health and wellness providers.\n    \n \n \n     Special considerations\n     \n \n \n    NIDA applicants are strongly encouraged to review the guidelines and adhere to the requirements applicable to their research listed in the\n     \n     Special Considerations for NIDA Funding Opportunities and Awards\n     \n    . Upon award, these considerations will be included in the Notice of Grant Award.\n    \n \n \n     National Cancer Institute (NCI)\n     \n \n \n    The National Cancer Institute (NCI) is not participating in this NOFO. Please do NOT submit R34 applications directed to NCI, as they will not be funded. However, NCI encourages applicants to incorporate aims that fit within the scope of this NOFO into their IRINAH R01 applications (submitted through\n     \n     PAR-23-298\n     \n    ). For further clarification, potential applicants are encouraged to contact the NCI Scientific Staff listed in\n     \n     PAR-23-298\n     \n    .\n    \n \n \n     National Institute on Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse (NIAAA)\n     \n \n \n    The National Institute on Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse (NIAAA) is interested in etiology, prevention, treatment, recovery, and health services research within Native American populations. NIAAA encourages research that engages AI/AN communities, considers native practices and concepts of health, and continues building a body of culturally appropriate research to address societal and cultural needs and health disparities. Such research can include, but is not limited to the following areas:\n    \n \n \n     Health promotion and alcohol use disorder (AUD) prevention, including interventions to reduce underage drinking and promote abstinence or reduction of alcohol use\n     \n \n     Comprehensive, multicomponent, community-based environmental interventions that address alcohol misuse and co-occurring conditions\n     \n \n     Interventions to reduce heavy alcohol use and binge-drinking\n     \n \n     Interventions that integrate individuals, families, communities, and other local support institutions into the prevention, treatment, and AUD recovery process\n     \n \n     Models and methods that enhance the diffusion, implementation, and adoption of evidence-based alcohol-related treatment practices across the full spectrum of services for individuals with AUD\n     \n \n     Innovative health services research to understand and expand the availability and acceptability of existing alcohol prevention and treatment services or/and increase uptake in both rural and urban dwelling Native American populations\n     \n \n \n \n     National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)\n     \n \n \n    The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) is interested in both non-AIDS and AIDS-related mental health interventions and services research relevant to priorities described in this NOFO and the\n     \n \n      NIMH Strategic Plan for Research\n      \n \n    . Practice-relevant research that incorporates the perspectives of community and practice partners is encouraged. Applications that propose adaptations to existing interventions should provide an empirical rationale for the need and focus of the adaptation, consistent with\n     \n \n      NAMHC Workgroup Report\n      \n \n    recommendations. Clinical trials\n     \n     testing individual-level interventions\n     \n    (i.e., the recipients are patients, family members, providers) must follow the\n     \n \n      NIMH experimental therapeutics approach\n      \n \n    and provide a plan to evaluate target engagement, including: an empirical justification for the selected target mechanism(s), measures of the targets(s), and an analytic approach to evaluate whether changes in the targets(s) are associated with changes in the outcomes.\n    \n \n    Clinical trials testing\n     \n     services interventions\n     \n    ,\n     \n     policy interventions, and/or implementation strategies\n     \n    must seek to understand how, why, for whom, and/or in what circumstances the intervention is effective, to ensure that the study results may be informative regardless of the primary outcomes.

Justifications for the premise of the research can be established based on documentation from scientific and/or cultural sources.\n    \n \n    Whenever possible, evidence should be included of the feasibility of planning and research activities proposed, including prior collaborations between the investigators and between the research team and study partners, prior experience working with the study population, and prior experience with the measures and methods to be used or tested in the research.\n    \n \n    When the research involves intervention development, adaptation, or acceptability and feasibility testing, the intervention (or the process of its initial development) must be described, including the theoretical and empirical evidence informing the intervention, the proposed mechanisms of action of the intervention, the health outcomes the intervention is meant to impact, and any relevant protective factors or risk factors that the intervention acts on or through for its hypothesized effects. When appropriate, the study should include plans for assessing fidelity of intervention and/or protocol implementation and/or plans for manualization or other standardization practices.The application must describe how the approach taken will support the future sustainability of the intervention, and any implications for implementing or disseminating the intervention if it is found to be effective in the future trial.\n    \n \n    The pilot studies proposed under this NOFO may or may not require a comparison condition. If included, the application should describe and justify the nature of any comparison/control group (e.g., whether the comparison group will receive information only, minimal treatment, or delayed intervention or some other design). Applicants should consult with collaborating communities to discuss the appropriateness of the selected approach to the comparison group, as tribal leaders and community members may believe that comparison group members should receive something more than usual care.\n    \n \n \n     Letters of Support\n     \n \n \n    Provide all appropriate letters of support, including those from community partners, collaborators, tribal resolutions, and others. Letters of support should describe the scientific, logistic, and organizational responsibilities of each of the collaborators for each aspect of the proposed project. The letter(s) of support should also describe the history of the partners in collaborating on prior research projects, or other mutually beneficial activities, the mutual understanding and cooperation among the partners, and the relative contributions to the previous projects.\n    \n \n \n     Each Native American organization that participates in the project should submit a letter of support.\n     \n \n     Applications that represent a partnership between a research organization and one or more tribes or communities should include a resolution from each tribal or community government or equivalent document, specifying that the community or tribe agrees to participate as a partner in the project and will strongly support the project for its entire duration.\n     \n \n     If the application includes a consortium of tribes or communities, applicants should provide a resolution of support from each tribe or community of the consortium.\n     \n \n     If the applicant is a tribally sanctioned non-profit tribal organization, specific tribal resolution(s) of support will not be required if the current tribal resolution(s) under which the organization operates encompasses activities proposed in the application. A copy of the current operational resolution(s) must be submitted with the application.\n     \n \n     In recognizing that Tribal governments are legal sovereign nations, potential partners should be informed that tribes may seek ownership or control of all data and all biological samples; therefore, universities and other partners should be prepared to negotiate data sharing and biological sample sharing agreements with tribes/Tribal government(s) as appropriate. If such an agreement is in place the applicant(s) should provide the letter of such an agreement with the application. Letters of Support should also explicitly stipulate that Tribes agree to respond expeditiously to requests for approval of the protocol, protocol modifications, approval of abstracts for presentation to scientific meetings, and approval of manuscripts for submission for publication in scientific journals. The time required for approving each of these (protocol, abstracts, manuscripts): 1) must be proposed and stated within the resolution of support, 2) may differ for each of these activities, 3) may be modified by study investigators only in consultation with the tribal/community leadership, and 4) should identify an individual or entity within the tribe or community to whom a request for waiver of the time requirement can be directed if circumstances arise. PD/PI(s) and tribes/communities are expected to publish scientific papers, present at scientific conferences/associations/meetings; and may also be expected to develop fact sheets/materials for dissemination to the tribe/community.\n     \n \n \n    If the applicant(s) is working with communities, tribes/tribal governments then community/tribal resolutions of support, or equivalent documents, should accompany the application whenever possible. However, tribal resolutions and letters of support from community collaborators may be submitted as post-submission material up to 30 days before the study section meeting. The date of the study section meeting will be posted in eRA after submission.\n     \n     Note that this flexibility is NOT\u00a0extended to letters of support from Key Personnel and consultants with academic or research organization affiliations.\n     \n    Letters of support from personnel with academic or research organization affiliations must be submitted with the application (on either October due date for non-AIDs applications or the January due date for AIDs applications listed in the Key Dates table above).\n    \n \n \n \n \n     Resource Sharing Plan:\n     \n    Individuals are required to comply with the instructions for the Resource Sharing Plans as provided in the How to Apply- Application Guide.\n    \n \n \n \n \n     Other Plan(s):\n     \n \n \n    All instructions in the How to Apply-Application Guide must be followed, with the following additional instructions:\n    \n \n \n \n \n     All applicants planning research (funded or conducted in whole or in part by NIH) that results in the generation of scientific data are required to comply with the instructions for the Data Management and Sharing Plan.

More information about the NIH HEAL Initiative is available at\n     \n     https://heal.nih.gov/\n     \n    .\u00a0The initiative has funded multiple pain workforce enhancement programs that support early-career investigators. Despite these efforts, the NIH HEAL Initiative can benefit from additionally supporting R15-eligible institutions that involve undergraduate, graduate or health professional school/colleges students in pain research.\n    \n \n    Since Fiscal Year (FY) 1985, NIH has made a special effort to stimulate research at educational institutions that provide baccalaureate and/or advanced degrees for a significant number of the nation\u2019s research scientists who have not been major recipients of NIH support. NIH has implemented two parent award programs, the Academic Research Enhancement Award (AREA) program (\n     \n     PAR-21-155\n     \n    ) and Research Enhancement Award Program (REAP) (\n     \n     PAR-22-060\n     \n    ), to provide research experiences to health professional or undergraduate and/or graduate students pursuing biomedical or behavioral research at U.S. higher education institutions. Utilizing these two programs will further promote a diverse\u00a0pain research workforce. This\n    Pain Research Enhancement Program (\u201cPREP\u201d) will further support\u00a0meritorious collaborative pain research from designated educational levels in the NIH HEAL Initiative, using the NIH Research Enhancement Award programs as a guide. Specifically, this NOFO aims to support new\u00a0scientific solutions to the national opioid public health crisis by establishing new research partnerships that will lead to research experiences for undergraduate, graduate, and health professional students, to further enhance the pool of potential participants in the pain research pipeline.\n    \n \n \n     Program Objectives:\n     \n \n \n    The purpose of this HEAL Initiative program is to: (1)\u00a0support basic and mechanistic pain research from R15-eligible undergraduate-focused serving institutions, health professional schools or graduate schools; (2) promote integrated, interdisciplinary research partnerships between Principal Investigators (PIs) from R15-eligible institutions and investigators from U.S. domestic institutions; and (3) enhance the pain research environment at the R15-eligible institution for health professional\u00a0students,\u00a0undergraduate and/or graduate students through active engagement in pain research.\n     \n \n      Successful applications will include plans detailing how they intend to accomplish all three goals.\n      \n \n    Please refer to Section III for specific R15 eligibility information. Although preliminary data are not required for an R15 application, they may be included if available. The scientific foundation for the proposed research should be based on published research and/or any available preliminary data.\n    \n \n \n     Objective 1: Develop Small-Scale\u00a0Basic and Mechanistic Pain Research Projects\n     \n \n \n    Proposed research projects should be hypothesis driven and use a rigorous scientific design to generate research data/evidence and advance scientific knowledge. Applications should include objectives that are attainable within the 3-year grant period.\n    \n \n    Pain research projects may include, but are not limited to, the study of:\u00a0nociception and/or pain processing in non-pain populations, acute pain, cancer pain, chemotherapy-induced neuropathy, chronic pain, diabetic neuropathy, eye pain, gynecologic pain, headache, musculoskeletal pain, myofascial pain, obstetric pain, osteoarthritis, pain conditions across the lifespan (including in the context of aging), pain co-occurring with substance use disorders (SUDs), painful disorders of the orofacial region, painful neuropathy, post-stroke pain, post-surgical pain, sickle cell pain, and/or visceral pain.\n     \n     Innovative pain research topics that propose an interdisciplinary mechanistic pain research are considered high program priority under this initiative.\n     \n \n \n    Projects may focus on\n     \n \n      basic\n      \n \n    pain research with pre-clinical (\n     \n     e.g.,\n     \n    animal or\n     \n     in silico\n     \n    ) models or\n     \n \n      involve research participants\n      \n \n    (\n     \n     e.g.,\n     \n    observational studies, epidemiological studies, secondary data analyses, or device development). Alternatively, investigators may propose a\n     \n \n      mechanistic and/or \u201cBasic Experimental Studies involving Humans\u201d (BESH) clinical trial\n      \n \n    as described below.\n    Clinical trials designed primarily to determine the safety, tolerability, and/or clinical efficacy of an intervention will be considered non-responsive to this NOFO and withdrawn without review.\n    \n \n    For this NOFO,\n     \n     only the following types of clinical trials will be supported:\n     \n \n \n \n \n \n       Basic Experimental Studies with Humans (BESH)\n       \n \n \n      ,\n      \n     defined as basic research studies involving humans that seek to understand the fundamental aspects of phenomena and of observable facts without specific applications towards processes or products in mind.\n     \n \n \n \n       Mechanistic trials\n       \n \n \n      ,\n      \n     defined as studies designed to understand a biological or behavioral process, the pathophysiology of a disease, or the mechanism of action of an intervention (i.e.,\n      \n      how\n      \n     an intervention works, but not\n      \n      if\n      \n     it works or is safe)\n     \n \n \n    NIH defines a clinical trial as a research study in which one or more human subjects are prospectively assigned to one or more interventions (which may include placebo or other control) to evaluate the effects of those interventions on health-related biomedical or behavioral outcomes (\n     \n     https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-15-015.html\n     \n    ).

However, it is expected that PD/PI(s) from R15-eligible institution(s) will lead the proposed project and complete most of the research at the R15-eligible institution. As such, PI(s) from R15-eligible institutions must\n    serve as the contact program director (PD)/PI for the project. Additionally, no more than one third of the total budget for the project may be used by the identified sub-award institution.\n    \n \n \n     Applications that propose new interdisciplinary are considered a high program priority under this NOFO.\u00a0Interdisciplinary\n     \n    partnership could include, but are not limited to, any two or more areas of research expertise from the following:\n    \n \n \n     Clinical pain management (e.g., nonpharmacologic or pharmacologic interventions)\n     \n \n     Clinical pain research\n     \n \n     Preclinical/basic pain biology and modeling\n     \n \n     Specific disease and/or pathological conditions (either human or preclinical models)\n     \n \n     Animal behavior\n     \n \n     Artificial intelligence\n     \n \n     Data science\n     \n \n \n \n     In addition, a Team Management Plan is required as part of Objective 2.\n     \n    Studies of team science have highlighted the need for effective management structures to achieve program goals. Many resources exist to aid in developing effective team-based programs (e.g., the\n     \n     National Cancer Institute Collaboration and Team Science Field Guide\n     \n    ). The Team Management Plan focuses on management of the whole team/key personnel. Because teams will likely include individuals from widely divergent scientific backgrounds, teams must have a shared vision and a defined plan for communication and management of shared responsibilities, interpersonal interactions, and professional credit.\u00a0The\n    Team Management Plan should be included as an attachment (three pages maximum) to this application. It should address how the research team, including the PI from R15-eligible Instiution and collaborator(s), will work together to accomplish program objectives.\u00a0See the application instructions for \u201cOther Attachments\u201d on the SF424(R&R) Other Project Information in Section IV.2 Instructions for Application Submission for details. The Team Management Plan should address the following points:\n    \n \n \n     Organizational structure and team composition and roles\n     \n \n     Shared leadership, contributions, and distributed responsibility for decision-making\n     \n \n     Resource sharing and allocation\n     \n \n     Credit assignment and/or intellectual property (IP) rights\n     \n \n     Coordination and communication plans\n     \n \n     Intra-team data sharing, archiving, and preservation\n     \n \n \n \n     Objective 3: Enhance the Research Environment by Engaging Students\n     \n \n \n    The third objective of this program is to enhance the pain research environment at the R15-eligible institution by engaging and providing research opportunities to health professional students or undergraduate and/or graduate students.\n     \n     A\n     \n \n     Facilities & Other Resources document is required to describe how the proposed research will enhance the pain research environment at the R15-eligible institution.\n     \n    Two-thirds of the proposed research project team should comprise personnel from the R15-eligible institutions, including\u00a0health professional students, or graduate students or undergraduate students from the primary R15-eligible institution.\u00a0Although the proposed research project must be led by the identified PD/PI,\n     \n     applications with strong and innovative student engagement are of high program priority.\n     \n    If participating students have not yet been identified, the number and academic stage of those to be involved should be provided. Applications should identify which aspects of the proposed research will include student participation. Student involvement may include participation in the design of experiments, collection and analysis of data, execution and troubleshooting of experiments, participation in research meetings, and discussion of future research directions. When applicable, it is highly desirable that student participation also include presentation\u00a0of research\u00a0at local and/or national meetings (including the HEAL Annual Scientific Meeting and \"Positively Uniting Researchers of Pain to Opine, Synthesize, & Engage\" {PURPOSE} meeting), publication of journal articles, and collaborative interactions. By engaging in these activities and collaborating on pain-focused research projects at\u00a0early stages of training, students will be better prepared and motivated to pursue careers in \u00a0pain\u00a0research. Please see Section III for a list of eligible students.\n    \n \n    This NOFO\n    aims to support pain\u00a0research grants, not training or fellowship program\n    s. As such,\n     \n \n      applications should not include training plans such as didactic training or non-research activities related to professional development.\n      \n \n    Likewise, applications should not include independent student research projects.\n    For applications that propose a clinical trial, the PD/PI must be the responsible individual of record for oversight of the trial though students can take part in all components of a clinical trial. Oversight includes (but is not limited to): interacting with relevant Institutional Review Board (IRB) staff; reviewing all informed consent documents; reporting potential serious adverse events; and maintaining responsibility for patient safety. However, the student can gain experience in all these components in conjunction with the individual leading the trial. Applications submitted to this NOFO may include additional investigators to those outlined above, including additional collaborators or consultants, or other individuals such as high school students, post-baccalaureate participants, postdoctoral fellows, or clinical fellows. However, involvement of such individuals does not fulfill the goal of enhancing the R15-eligible institutional environment and should account for less than one third of the overall proposed project team.\n    \n \n \n     Additional Information\n     \n \n \n \n     Non-responsiveness Criteria:\n     \n \n \n \n     Applications deemed to be non-responsive will not proceed to review and will be withdrawn. Applications with one or more of the following characteristics are considered non-responsive to this NOFO:\n     \n \n \n \n     Research that does not address the\n      \n      NIH HEAL Initiative\n      \n     mission to enhance pain management.\n     \n \n     Failure to describe a proposed Research plan and specific aims primarily led by a PI from a R15-eligible Institution.\n     \n \n     Omission of a domestic research partnership and accompanying sub award(s), or that include sub-award(s) that account for more than one third of the total project budget.\n     \n \n     Failure to include the required Facilities & Other Resources document and Other Attachments, including a Team Management Planand,\n     letters of support, including\u00a0a letter of support from the identified subaward holder(s) and a letter of support from the R15-eligible institution\u2019s provost. Please see s\n     ection IV.2 \u201cInstructions for Application Submission\u201d for details.\n     \n \n     Proposing a clinical trial addressing safety, tolerability, efficacy, and/or effectiveness of pharmacologic, behavioral, biologic, surgical, or device (invasive or noninvasive) interventions.\n     \n \n \n \n     Contacting Program Officers Prior to Submission\n     \n \n \n    Applicants are strongly encouraged to consult with\n     \n     program staff\n     \n    as plans for an application are being developed.\n    \n \n \n     Rigor and Reproducibility\n     \n \n \n    NIH strives for rigor and transparency in all research it funds. For this reason, the\u00a0NIH HEAL Initiative\n     \n \n    explicitly emphasizes the NIH application instructions related to rigor and transparency (\n     \n     https://grants.nih.gov/policy/reproducibility/guidance.htm\n     \n    ) and provides additional guidance from individual NIH institutes and centers (ICs) to the scientific community. For example, the biological rationale for the proposed experiments must be based on rigorous and robust supporting data, which means that data should be collected via methods that minimize the risk of bias and be reported in a transparent manner. If previously published or preliminary studies do not meet these standards, applicants should address how the current study design addresses the deficiencies in rigor and transparency. Proposed experiments should likewise be designed in a manner that minimizes the risk of bias and ensures validity of experimental results.\n    \n \n    Proposed research projects should incorporate adequate methodological rigor where applicable, including but not limited to a clear rationale for the chosen model(s) and primary/secondary endpoint(s), clear descriptions of tools and parameters, blinding, randomization, adequate sample size, prespecified inclusion/exclusion criteria, appropriate handling of missing data and outliers, appropriate controls, pre-planned analyses, and appropriate quantitative techniques.\n    \n \n    Applications should also clearly indicate the exploratory vs. confirmatory components of the study, consider study limitations, and plan for transparent reporting of all methods, analyses, and results so that other investigators can evaluate the quality of the work and potentially perform replications. NIH intends to maximize the impact of NIH HEAL Initiative-supported projects through broad and rapid data sharing and immediate access to publications (\n     \n     https://heal.nih.gov/about/public-access-data\n     \n    ). Guidelines for complying with the HEAL Public Access and Data Sharing Policy can be found at\n     \n     https://heal.nih.gov/data/complying-heal-data-sharing-policy\n     \n    .

One key consideration is that teams employing multidisciplinary approaches and having diverse areas of intellectual and technical expertise are more productive if the process for making decisions incorporates different points of view. The Team Management Plan should describe how major decisions will be made or how conflicts will be resolved.\n    \n \n \n     Resource sharing and allocation across the team:\n     \n    Applications should describe management and decision-making processes that promote collective input for allocation of program resources with flexibility when resources may need to be dynamically reallocated to achieve programmatic goals. A plan for how intra-team, institutional, and regional resources that are integral to the team goals will be shared and made accessible to team members should also be included.\n    \n \n \n     Credit assignment:\n     \n    A plan for how credit and intellectual property (IP) will be shared, especially with the R15 institution\u2019s students, should be included. Methods for attributing contributions to publications should be described to enable individual professional assessment in joint projects.\n    \n \n \n     Coordination and communication plans:\n     \n    Practical aspects should be described, including frequency and logistics of real-time communication across all key personnel, consultants, scholars, early-stage investigators, etc., and other significant contributors regardless of effort level.\n    \n \n    An important and meaningful impact of team science may come from shaping the next generation of pain scientists. Because of the interdisciplinary expertise of the research groups, students are exposed to and can learn a variety of scientific approaches and methodologies, resulting in multifaceted early-stage investigators.

Criteria\n    \n \n    Only the review criteria described below will be considered in the review process. Applications submitted to the NIH in support of the\n     \n     NIH mission\n     \n    are evaluated for scientific and technical merit through the NIH peer review system.\n    \n \n \n \n    For this particular NOFO, note the following:\n     \n    The purpose of this NIH HEAL Initiative program is to (1) support the efforts by R15-eligible principal investigators (PIs) at primarily undergraduate-focused serving institutions or health professional schools and graduate schools to conduct small-scale basic and mechanistic pain research projects; (2) promote integrated, interdisciplinary research partnerships between R15-eligible PIs and investigators from U.S. domestic institutions; and (3) enhance the pain research environment at the R15-eligible institution for health professional students or undergraduate and/or graduate students by actively engaging them in the proposed pain research projects.\n     \n    Applications in response to this NOFO should include plans to accomplish these goals. Specifically, applications should include a rigorous plan for conducting basic and mechanistic pain research projects in the Research Strategy section of the application. In addition, a research partnership between the PI\u2019s institution and at least one investigator from a separate U.S. domestic institution that provides resources and/or expertise that will enhance the proposed pain research program must be included in a separate\n     \n     Team Management Plan\n     \n    . The proposed partnership will be a sub-award agreement(s) with at least one partnering institution, which does not need to be R15-eligible. The budget of all sub-awards must not exceed one third of the total budget. Furthermore, applications must include a\n     \n     Facilities & Other Resources\n     \n \n     document\n     \n    that demonstrates active involvement of health professional students or undergraduate and/or graduate students from the R15-eligible institution(s) in the proposed pain research projects.\n    \n \n    Although preliminary data are not required for an R15 application, they may be included if available. The scientific foundation for the proposed research should be based on published research and/or any available preliminary data.\n    \n \n    A proposed Clinical Trial application may include study design, methods, and intervention that are not by themselves innovative but address important questions or unmet needs. Additionally, the results of the clinical trial may indicate that further clinical development of the intervention is unwarranted or lead to new avenues of scientific investigation.\n    \n \n \n   Overall Impact\n    \n    Reviewers will provide an overall impact score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood for the project to make important scientific contributions to the research field(s) involved, while providing research opportunities to [undergraduate or graduate or health professional students] and strengthening the research environment of the institution, in consideration of the following review criteria and additional review criteria (as applicable for the project proposed).\n    \n \n \n   Scored Review Criteria\n    \n    Reviewers will consider Factors 1, 2 and 3 in the determination of scientific merit, and in providing an overall impact score. In addition, Factors 1 and 2 will each receive a separate criterion score. An application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged as a high impact R15 application. For example, a solid and interesting scientific research project that is not by its nature innovative or paradigm-shifting, and includes a good plan to engage [undergraduate or graduate or health professional students] in primary research may be considered a strong R15 application.\n    \n \n \n \n    Factor 1.

Additional Requirements for NIH HEAL Initiative studies conducting clinical research or research involving human subjects.\n     \n \n \n    These studies must meet the following additional requirements:\n    \n \n \n     NIH HEAL Initiative trials that are required to register in clinicaltrials.gov should reference support from and inclusion in the NIH HEAL Initiative by including the standardized term \u201cthe HEAL Initiative (\n      \n      https://heal.nih.gov/\n      \n     )\u201d in the Study Description Section.\n     \n \n     All new NIH HEAL Initiative clinical pain studies are required to use core questionnaires required by the HEAL Common Data Elements (CDE) Program (\n      \n      https://heal.nih.gov/data/common-data-elements\n      \n     ). Outside of the core questionnaires, studies should select questionnaires from among the repository of supplemental questionnaires that are already being used by other NIH HEAL Initiative clinical pain studies. The program has created CDE files containing standardized variable names, responses, coding, and other information for all of these questionnaires. The program has also formatted the case report forms in a standardized way that is compliant with accessibility standards under Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C \u00a7 794 (d);\n      \n      https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2011-title29/html/USCODE-2011-title29-chap16-subchapV-sec794d.htm\n      \n     ) which \u201crequire[s] Federal agencies to make their electronic and information technology accessible to people with disabilities.\u201d\n      \n \n       Studies that wish to use questionnaires not already included in the HEAL CDE repository should consult with their program official and the HEAL CDE team. New questionnaires will be considered for inclusion in the repository on a case-by-case basis and only when appropriate justification is provided.\n       \n \n       NIH HEAL Initiative clinical studies that are using copyrighted questionaries are required to obtain licenses for use prior to initiating data collection. Licenses must be shared with the HEAL CDE team and the program officer prior to use of copyrighted materials. For additional information, visit the HEAL CDE Program (\n        \n        https://heal.nih.gov/data/common-data-elements\n        \n       ).\n       \n \n \n \n     To the extent possible, all other (nonpain) HEAL studies conducting clinical trials or research involving human subjects are expected to use questionnaires by the HEAL CDE Program (\n      \n      https://heal.nih.gov/data/common-data-elements\n      \n     ) if applicable and relevant to their research.\n     \n \n     To the extent possible, NIH HEAL Initiative awardees are expected to integrate broad data sharing consent language into their informed consent forms.\n     \n \n \n    Additional details, resources, and tools to assist with data-related activities can be found at\n     \n     https://www.healdatafair.org\n     \n    .\n    Budgeting guidance for data sharing can be found in\n     \n     NOT-OD-21-015\n     \n    and the\n     \n     NIH Scientific Data Sharing site\n     \n    .\n    \n \n    All data collected as part of the NIH HEAL Initiative are collected under a Certificate of Confidentiality and entitled to the protections thereof. Institutions who receive data and/or materials from this award for performance of activities under this award are required to use the data and/or materials only as outlined by the NIH HEAL Initiative, in a manner that is consistent with applicable state and Federal laws and regulations, including any informed consent requirements and the terms of the institution\u2019s NIH funding, including\n     \n     NOT-OD-17-109\n     \n    and 42 U.S.C. 241(d).

Notice of Funding Opportunity Description PAR-25-155: Limited Competition: Small Grant Program for the NCATS Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) Program (R03 Clinical Trial Optional) Section I. Notice of Funding Opportunity Description\n    \n \n \n \n \n     Background\n     \n \n \n    Biomedical translation leverages a process of turning observations from the laboratory, clinic and community into interventions that improve the health of individuals and the public \u2014 from diagnostics and therapeutics to medical procedures and behavioral changes. Each research stage across the translational spectrum from target validation through intervention development to public health benefit assessment, is currently fraught with inefficiency and in need of bold, new, innovative solutions. Thus, there has remained a need for bold, new, innovative experimental approaches to identifying such solutions.\n    \n \n    Translational Science, a field dedicated to optimizing biomedical translation, is aimed at generating scientific and operational innovations that overcome longstanding challenges along the translational research pipeline. The Translational Science approach is not to focus on specific diseases, but on what is common among them including: scientific and operational innovations that can be applied across diseases; for developing and applying new research approaches, technologies, resources, and/or models; for demonstrating their usefulness; and for disseminating the data, analysis and methodologies to the community.\n    \n \n    The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), leverages Translational Science innovations to advance progress along the translational pathway. Ultimately, to lead to more treatments for all people more quickly. Indeed, NCATS strives to develop innovations to reduce, remove or bypass costly and time-consuming bottlenecks in the translational research pathway in an effort to speed the delivery of new drugs, diagnostics and medical devices to patients. NCATS' catalysis of the development, demonstration, and dissemination of innovations across the spectrum of translational science will advance its mission to transform the effectiveness of translation of discoveries from the laboratory, clinic, and community into tangible benefits to human health.\n    \n \n    The NCATS Translational Science Principles\n     \n     characterize effective approaches for translation, and exemplify NCATS\u2019 core approaches for advancing translational progress.\n     \n    These principles are described on the NCATS website at -\n     \n     https://ncats.nih.gov/training-education/translational-science-principles.\n     \n    The principles are intentionally broad and apply to research anywhere along the translational continuum. While they exemplify translational science approaches, they are not intended to be comprehensive.\n    \n \n \n     Purpose\n     \n \n \n    This is a limited competition. The purpose of this notice of funding opportunity (NOFO) is to support small self-contained translational science research projects that may be carried out in a short period of time with limited resources and are expected to 1) address a general roadblock in science and/or operations that limits the efficiency and effectiveness of translation; 2) develop, demonstrate, and/or disseminate innovative solutions and/or new or better treatments that will have an impact on improving the health of patients; and 3) provide outcomes and preliminary data likely to serve as the basis for the transition of clinical and translational scientists to fully independent academic translational scientists. There is not an expectation that projects supported by the NOFO will likely \"move the field forward\" at this stage. Yet within the context of the NCATS approach and focus on translational science, the results of a project responsive to this NOFO would be expected to be translated to one or more diseases and/or generalizable.\n    \n \n    The NOFO will support Small Grant Program (R03) applications from NCATS Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) Program\u2019s KL2/K12 scholars whom have been recently supported directly by the CTSA Program. Applications must be submitted for R03 due dates within 2 years of completion of the KL2/K12 appointment. Complete eligibility details are described below (Section III. Eligibility Information).\n    \n \n    By providing this funding, the NCATS CTSA Program intends to foster the successful development of the next generation of clinical and translational science leaders trying to launch their independent research careers by augmenting previous investments. This grant support by the CTSA Program is expected to have the following benefits:\n    \n \n \n     An opportunity for the recipient to demonstrate additional success in the NIH peer review process\n     \n \n     An opportunity for the recipient to generate new data, increase scientific output, and/or identify a path forward (new collaboration, clinical trial, Investigational New Drug (IND) application, partnership with a company, etc.) for the clinical and translational science research project\n     \n \n     An opportunity to prepare and submit a subsequent R01, or equivalent, application.\n     \n \n \n    Projects supported under this NOFO may include, but are not limited to:\n    \n \n \n     Conduct of pilot and feasibility studies; secondary data analysis of existing data; small, self-contained research projects; software or app development,\n      \n      t,\n      \n     that would support the catalysis of a tangible scientific outcome or result in a change in approach (\"fast-fail\").\n     \n \n     Development of new research technology, method or approach that addresses a general roadblock in science and/or operations that limits the efficiency and effectiveness of translation.\n     \n \n     Demonstration in one or more use cases whether the tool, method, or approach is effective in accelerating research translation, utilizing clear and meaningful metrics and outcomes.\n     \n \n \n    Examples include, but are not limited to:\n    \n \n \n     Community engagement methods and technologies that increase the efficiency and effectiveness of intervention development and deployment, and measurement of their effects on improving health outcomes. Community engagement should be defined broadly to include local and distributed, physical and virtual communities.\n     \n \n     Development of transformative technologies (such as digital health, telehealth, data science, artificial intelligence, machine learning) to increase efficiency during implementation of clinical research studies or clinical trials (e.g., study site selection and activation, recruitment and retention, patient reported outcomes, biomarker identification and validation, data collection and analysis, risk communication, clinical monitoring, data and safety monitoring, interoperability of electronic health record systems and clinical research data management systems).\n     \n \n     Strategies to engage understudied/underreported populations in clinical research and clinical trials.\n     \n \n     Clinical, genetic or machine-learning approaches that speed the identification or accurate diagnosis of patients to shorten the diagnostic odyssey encountered by patients.\n     \n \n     Approaches that more rapidly identify the molecular underpinnings of genetic diseases and potential targets for therapeutics development, such as computationally-assisted modeling.\n     \n \n     Innovative applications and integration of data science, informatics tools and/or artificial intelligence/machine learning to make data more meaningful, open and accessible for the scientific community (predictive modeling, algorithms, simulation technologies, creation and dissemination of knowledge networks).\n     \n \n     Strategies or approaches to reduce the time to adoption of an intervention.\n     \n \n \n \n     Applications Not Responsive to this NOFO:\n     \n \n \n    The following types of studies are not responsive to this NOFO.

Application Review Information\n    \n \n \n \n    1. Criteria\n    \n \n    Only the review criteria described below will be considered in the review process. Applications submitted to the NIH in support of the\n     \n     NIH mission\n     \n    are evaluated for scientific and technical merit through the NIH peer review system.\n    \n \n \n \n    For this particular announcement, note the following:\n    \n \n    The R03 small grant supports discrete, well-defined projects that realistically can be completed in two years and that require limited levels of funding. Because the research project usually is limited, an R03 grant application may not contain extensive detail or discussion. Accordingly, reviewers should evaluate the conceptual framework and general approach to the problem. Appropriate justification for the proposed work can be provided through literature citations, data from other sources, or from investigator-generated data. Preliminary data are not required, particularly in applications proposing pilot or feasibility studies.\n    \n \n \n   Overall Impact\n    \n    Reviewers will provide an overall impact score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood for the project to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the research field(s) involved, in consideration of the following scored review criteria and additional review criteria (as applicable for the project proposed). An application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged likely to have a major scientific impact.\n    \n \n \n   Scored Review Criteria\n    \n    Reviewers will evaluate Factors 1, 2 and 3 in the determination of scientific merit, and in providing an overall impact score. In addition, Factors 1 and 2 will each receive a separate criterion score.\n    \n \n \n \n    Factor 1. Importance of the Research (Significance and Innovation)\n    \n \n \n \n \n \n        Significance\n        \n \n \n \n \n       Evaluate the importance of the proposed research in the context of current scientific challenges and opportunities, either for advancing knowledge within the field, or more broadly. Assess whether the application addresses an important gap in knowledge in the field, would solve a critical problem, or create a valuable conceptual or technical advance.\n       \n \n       Evaluate the rationale for undertaking the study, the rigor of the scientific background for the work (e.g., prior literature and/or preliminary data) and whether the scientific background justifies the proposed study.\n       \n \n \n \n \n        Innovation\n        \n \n \n \n \n       Evaluate the extent to which innovation influences the importance of undertaking the proposed research. Note that while technical or conceptual innovation can influence the importance of the proposed research, a project that is not applying novel concepts or approaches may be of critical importance for the field.\n       \n \n       Evaluate whether the proposed work applies novel concepts, methods or technologies\u00a0or uses existing concepts, methods, technologies\u00a0in novel ways, to enhance\u00a0the overall impact of the project.\n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        Specific to this NOFO:\n        \n \n \n \n      Evaluate and describe the extent to which the Project adequately:\n      \n \n      1) addresses a general roadblock in science and/or operations that limits the efficiency and effectiveness of translation;\n      \n \n      2) develops, demonstrates, and/or disseminates innovative solutions and/or new or better treatments that will improve the health of patients; and\n      \n \n      3) provides outcomes and preliminary data likely to serve as the basis for the transition of clinical and translational scientists to fully independent academic translational scientists\n      \n \n \n    Factor 2.

Notice of Funding Opportunity Description PAR-25-315: Elucidating Immunometabolic Responses to HIV Infection that Increase TB or HBV Risk (R01 Clinical Trial Not Allowed) Section I. Notice of Funding Opportunity Description\n    \n \n \n \n \n     Background\n     \n \n \n    People living with HIV (PLWH) are 18-times more likely to develop active tuberculosis (TB) than people without HIV, and TB is the leading cause of death in PLWH. Likewise, nearly eight percent of PLWH are also living with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV), and they have an 8-10% risk of developing HBV-related complications, including cirrhosis, fibrosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It is unclear why combination antiretroviral therapy (cART)-induced viral suppression does not fully abrogate risk of TB progression, chronic HBV, or HBV-related liver disease.\n    \n \n    During infection, immune cells respond in a rapid, dynamic, and metabolically costly fashion; given such alterations to the immunometabolic landscape, the immune response to a second infection would inevitably be altered. Immunometabolism refers to the interface between the immune system and metabolism: the host metabolic state directly regulates immune activation and downstream immune cell signaling. The fields of both immunometabolism and infectious disease systems biology have made tremendous strides in recent years, and their combined application provides an auspicious opportunity to make clinically relevant discoveries. Specifically, immunometabolism pathways have never been mined for biomarkers or host directed therapy (HDT) targets for understanding disease progression and treating PLWH who are also living with TB or HBV. To perform this work, immunologically relevant model systems must be optimized to dissect metabolic pathways using multi-omic and network-based analyses of immune cell subsets.\n    \n \n \n     Purpose and Research Objectives\n     \n \n \n    HIV infection induces long-term immune cell metabolic remodeling; how such alterations impact the immune response and risk to a second, potentially long-term, infection such as\n     \n     Mycobacterium tuberculosis\n     \n    (\n     \n     Mtb\n     \n    ) or HBV, is not well defined. This initiative aims to support investigator-led, multidisciplinary research to define how HIV-driven alterations to immunometabolism affect immune cell regulation, cell-cell interactions, response to treatment, and, ultimately, TB and HBV progression. Elucidating and subsequently probing such mechanisms should lead to identification of candidate biomarkers of disease progression and/or potential targets for immune-modulatory treatment (i.e., host-directed therapy) to decrease TB and HBV risk in PLWH.\n    \n \n \n     Specific Areas of Research Interest\n     \n \n \n    This notice of funding opportunity (NOFO) will support hypothesis-driven basic, preclinical, and translational laboratory research studies that will elucidate immunometabolic alterations during HIV infection that increase risk of TB or HBV disease, with the goal of identifying key mechanism and pathways that can be leveraged for new therapeutic and diagnostic strategies.\n    \n \n    Research topics of interest on HIV immunometabolism and increased risk to either TB or HBV include, but are not limited to:\n    \n \n \n     Studies of alterations to immunometabolism due to HIV infection and the impact of such alterations on TB or HBV disease progression and/or pathogenesis of\n      \n      Mtb\n      \n     or HBV.\n     \n \n     Defining the role of immunometabolism in cell-cell interactions in HIV co-infection with\n      \n      Mtb\n      \n     or HBV.\n     \n \n     Dissection of multi-omic immune cell profiles and correlates of disease progression during co-infection (HIV with\n      \n      Mtb\n      \n     , HIV with HBV, or HIV with\n      \n      Mtb\n      \n     and HBV).\n     \n \n     Discovery of immunometabolism-associated therapeutic targets or biomarkers of disease progression during co-infection.\n     \n \n \n    Applicants are strongly encouraged to:\n    \n \n \n     Form inter-disciplinary teams to leverage a range of strengths and expertise among multiple investigators.\n     \n \n     Apply novel machine learning or artificial intelligence (AI) approaches.\n     \n \n     Utilize existing clinical samples in conjunction with translational approaches including in vitro and in vivo model systems.\n     \n \n \n \n     Applications not responsive to this NOFO:\n     \n \n \n    Applications proposing the following will be considered non-responsive and will not be reviewed:\n    \n \n \n     Elucidation of immunometabolic changes driven by causes other than HIV infection.\n     \n \n     Exploration of immunometabolic effects of HIV infection without co-infection.\n     \n \n \n      Clinical trials\n      \n \n \n \n    This NOFO is soliciting R01 applications that support a discrete, specified, circumscribed project (up to 5 years) to be performed by the named investigator(s) in an area representing the investigator's specific interest and competencies.

Notice of Funding Opportunity Description PAR-25-342: Interventions on Health and Healthcare Disparities on Non-Communicable and Chronic Diseases in Latin America: Improving Health Outcomes Across the Hemisphere (R01 - Clinical Trial Required) Section I. Notice of Funding Opportunity Description\n    \n \n \n \n \n     Key Definitions\n     \n \n \n \n     Healthcare models\n     \n    refer to existing or newly proposed models of patient-centered care. Examples of existing healthcare models include the Chronic Care Model, the eHealth Enhanced Chronic Care Model, the Community-Based Transition Model, the Nurse Management Model, the Home-Based Model, the Integrated Delivery Systems Model, the Patient-Centered Model, and the Value-Based Care Models, among others.\n    \n \n \n     Multicomponent\n     \n    refers to frameworks with more than one component of a healthcare (e.g., healthcare system or organization, clinician decision support, clinical information system, patient self-management support, delivery system design).\n    \n \n \n     Multilevel\n     \n    refers to the multidimensional framework of determinants relevant to understanding minority health and addressing health disparities. This concept is further described under the NIMHD Research Framework (\n     \n     https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/about/overview/research-framework/\n     \n    ).\n    \n \n \n \n      Background\n      \n \n \n \n    Non-communicable and chronic diseases (NCDs) have been progressively recognized and studied in Latin America. There is notable variability in both NCDs prevalence and mortality across countries. For instance, in 2019, 81% of all-cause fatalities throughout Latin America were associated with NCDs. For example, the prevalence of diabetes is increasing throughout the region, yet has been consistently higher in Mexico and Puerto Rico, where it is also one of the five leading causes of death. Suicide and homicide are associated with a significant proportion of deaths throughout Latin America, while the burden of non-fatal interpersonal violence is also significant. COVID-19 broadly impacted Latin America, leaving behind strained healthcare systems and long-term consequences that are yet to be understood.\n    \n \n    At the same time, multiple innovations have been emerging throughout Latin America that could impact the health of all Hispanic/Latino persons across the hemisphere and transcend to other populations. For example, significant breakthroughs in understanding mechanisms of premature onset Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), clinical manifestations preceding AD and clinical phenotypes of AD in different Latin American countries have been emerging. Insights on genetic ancestry, social determinants of health and risk for Type 2 diabetes, and pharmacogenomics and dosing of anticoagulation therapy have also been described. Furthermore, the integration of various digital technologies into health care including cancer care, multidisciplinary diabetic foot care, management of diabetic retinopathy referral, and rapid assessment of retinopathy/blindness, innovative comprehensive diabetes care models (including enhanced diabetes self-management), and team-based primary care models have been successful in different settings.\n    \n \n    As of 2020, 62.1 million (18.9%) persons living in the U.S. 50 States self-identified as Hispanic/Latino. Despite the cumulative evidence supporting guidelines for prevention, diagnosis, and care for many non-communicable and chronic diseases (NCDs), the prevalence, and awareness, treatment, and control goals for these conditions among U.S. Hispanics/Latinos continues being unacceptably high and needs attention. These facts also highlight the significant need for additional research on Hispanic/Latino health with a focus on effective prevention and models of healthcare.\u00a0In addition to NCDs, interpersonal violence and suicide are among the top three leading causes of death among U.S. Hispanic/Latino persons aged 15-34 years. In 2020, the previously documented longer life expectancy among the U.S. Hispanic/Latino population compared to White and Black or African American persons significantly narrowed because of the high mortality associated with COVID-19.\n    \n \n    The landmark Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL) was initiated in 2006 and has documented differences in the prevalence of health risk factors and NCDs among U.S. Hispanic/Latino persons from different heritage groups. For example, a significantly higher prevalence of five cardiovascular risk factors and self-reported cardiovascular disease (CVD) among participants of Puerto Rican descent, and a greater prevalence of hypertension among Hispanic/Latino persons of Caribbean descent were reported compared to other Hispanic/Latino heritage populations in HCHS/SOL. People of Puerto Rican descent had a greater risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD), and those of Mexican, Puerto Rican and Dominican descent had a higher prevalence of diabetes compared to other Hispanic/Latino heritage populations in HCHS/SOL. In contrast, analyses at the population level have found that U.S. Hispanics/Latinos (as a group) have consistently lower all-cause, cardiovascular and cancer mortality compared to White and Black or African American persons. However, various studies have documented higher all-cause, cardiovascular and cancer mortality rates among U.S. Hispanic/Latino persons of Puerto Rican descent compared to those of Mexican or Cuban descent.\n    \n \n    The U.S. Hispanic/Latino population is constituted by communities that have lived in the mainland long before it became the U.S., have immigrated to the U.S., or live in U.S. territories. Many U.S. Hispanics/Latinos maintain contact with their or their ancestors\u2019 country of origin. Considering the parallel similarities and differences between U.S. Hispanic/Latino groups and among Latin American countries, bold and strategic U.S. and Latin America collaborations have strong potential to improve health outcomes and the reduction\u00a0 of health disparities among these populations. Therefore, the overarching goal of this NOFO is to support innovative and collaborative research seeking to\u00a0identify, develop, and test innovative strategies to address these health pressing issues, as well as to overcome barriers to the adoption, adaptation, scale-up, and sustainability of evidence-based guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis, and care for NCDs. Such collaborations could uncover mechanisms or mediators of previously documented differences among Latin American and U.S. Hispanic/Latino populations, and further the understanding of the sociocultural, environmental, clinical care/research and healthcare contexts that cannot be understood or identified through research conducted solely in the U.S. Furthermore, such research could inform current and future interventions to promote timely prevention, diagnosis and care of persons with NCDs more effectively across the hemisphere.\n    \n \n \n \n      Research Objectives\n      \n \n \n \n    This NOFO will support innovative, collaborative, and multidisciplinary research focused on clinical, health services and/or community-based interventions that address\u00a0health and healthcare disparities related to NCDs with the highest disease burden and mortality in Latin America and among U.S. Hispanics/Latinos. Those NCDs include obesity, diabetes and related complications, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia/dyslipidemia, cancer, chronic lung disease (including asthma), chronic kidney disease, osteoarthritis, as well as chronic liver disease and cirrhosis. In addition, sleep disordered breathing, cognitive impairment and dementia, and mental and behavioral health conditions have been increasingly studied in Hispanic/Latino persons in the U.S., and throughout Latin America, yet their diagnosis is often delayed.\u00a0Considering the significant incidence of both fatal and non-fatal interpersonal violence across Latin America and U.S. Hispanic/Latino communities, research in this topic is also of interest.\u00a0Although most studies on NCDs have focused on adults, some studies have highlighted the increasing prevalence of children with chronic diseases and their unique needs. Therefore, children will be included in this initiative.\n    \n \n    This NOFO will support research on interventions (especially multicomponent or multilevel interventions), encompassing community-based and health system-based interventions, quasi-experimental studies, and clinical trials (including cluster-randomized trials, pragmatic trials), and other research designs that address the health and healthcare disparities in primary prevention, and/or awareness, effective treatment, and control of NCDs across the region. Evaluation of interventions is of interest and can be included in the proposed scope of work.\n    \n \n    Studies that explore barriers and facilitators to equitable access and utilization of health care services and patient retention across fragmented healthcare systems, and the delivery of interventions to overcome such barriers with adequate fidelity (i.e., delivered as intended) are of high interest. The development and testing of strategies to expand prevention and care of NCDs into community settings is also encouraged. Projects should also demonstrate the impact of these strategies and interventions on health outcomes and health/healthcare disparities. Studies that incorporate comparative analyses involving more than one Latin American country and/or U.S. Hispanic/Latino populations are welcome.\n    \n \n    Projects will include studies conducted in Latin American countries where Spanish is the main language. Studies performed in countries more highly represented (including Puerto Rico) in the U.S. Hispanic/Latino population will be prioritized. Puerto Rico would be considered both a U.S. territory and part of Latin America. Research teams are expected to include both U.S.-based and Latin America-based investigators; Puerto Rico-based teams are not required to include investigators from other U.S.-based institutions. U.S.-based institutions -including Puerto Rico-will be the award recipients, but the proportion of the budget and research activities would be significantly larger for Latin America-based institutions (in the range of 30% to U.S.-based institutions and 70% to Latin America-based institutions), where the majority of the research is expected to be conducted. Research teams are also expected to include at least one PI or MPI from institutions in Latin America. The expectations regarding the research teams' composition and budget proportion are not based on race or ethnicity. These expectations are based on the ability and experience of local investigators to facilitate studies involving populations with whom they are acquainted in the geographic areas of interest, and who would have a better understanding of the health conditions, public health and healthcare needs, healthcare systems, or social determinants of health in the locations where the studies will take place. Collaborations (e.g., consultative, or subject-matter expert role) with investigators or research teams from Latin American countries with low representation in the U.S. Hispanic/Latino population are welcome.\n    \n \n \n \n      Specific Research Areas of Interest\n      \n \n    include but are not limited to:\n    \n \n \n     Development and testing interventions -especially within the primary care setting-that\n      \n      optimize prevention\n      \n     , treatment\n      \n      effectiveness\n      \n     , improve patient self-management, and reduce\n      \n      preventable complications\n      \n     (including but not limited to hospital readmissions) associated with NCDs.

Notice of Funding Opportunity Description PAR-25-354: Multidisciplinary Studies of HIV/AIDS and Aging (R01 Clinical Trial Optional) Section I. Notice of Funding Opportunity Description\n    \n \n \n \n    Background\n    \n \n    Currently, roughly 53%of American adults living with HIV are over the age of 50. By 2030, that number is projected to rise to over 70%. The portion of older adults with HIV is expected to rise primarily because of the successes of modern antiretroviral therapy (ART), which has allowed individuals infected at a younger age to survive into older age. Additionally, the prevalence of HIV infection in older age is attributable to new infections in later life, with approximately 16% of new diagnoses in Americans occurring in adults age 50 and older.\n    \n \n    In contrast to the pre-modern era of HIV treatment, where AIDS-related opportunistic infections and cancers were common, the most frequent morbidities and causes of death for individuals undergoing treatment for HIV infection are similar to those seen in older non-infected adults. These conditions include cardiovascular disease, lung disease, infection-related and non-infection-related cancers, neurocognitive and neuropsychiatric disorders, osteopenia/osteoporosis, liver cirrhosis, and renal disease. In addition, individuals living with HIV infection may exhibit many of the clinical and socio-behavioral characteristics commonly observed in aging, such as multiple morbidities, polypharmacy, declining physical and cognitive function, alterations in body composition, social isolation, and increasing caregiver burden. People living with HIV (PLWH) also exhibit molecular changes associated with aging, such as epigenetic alterations, mitochondrial impairment, and telomere shortening. Thus, accumulating evidence suggests that HIV and/or its treatment may lead, at least in part, to an accelerated aging phenotype. In addition, recent advances have led to greater adoption of pre-and post-exposure prophylaxis, but the impact of these measures on aging is unclear.\n    \n \n    Purpose\n    \n \n    This NOFO invites applications at the intersection of HIV and aging by proposing research that aims to meet the following objectives:\n    \n \n    1) Improve the understanding of biological, clinical, and socio-behavioral aspects of aging through the lens of HIV infection and its treatment; and\n    \n \n    2) Improve approaches for testing, preventing, and treating HIV infection, and managing HIV-related comorbidities, co-infections, and complications in different populations and settings by applying current aging science approaches.\n    \n \n    Scope\n    \n \n    Proposed research must be consistent with the HIV/AIDS Research Priorities outlined by NIH\u2019s Office of AIDS Research (OAR) as described in\n     \n     NOT-OD-20-018\n     \n    . This NOFO encourages applications with the following characteristics:\n    \n \n \n \n      Clinical orientation:\n      \n     HIV in aging involves complex interactions among multiple physiologic systems and a variety of human-level factors such as functional status, quality of life, health behaviors, and psychosocial issues; therefore, studying individual factors in isolation may be counter-productive. This NOFO encourages animal models and\n      \n      in vitro\n      \n     studies where appropriate; however, inclusion of such approaches should be integrated with human studies or demonstrate direct relevance to clinical features of HIV/AIDS.\n     \n \n \n      Focus on aging or the aged:\n      \n \n \n     Applicants are strongly encouraged to enroll individuals across the range of older ages, especially individuals at the upper end of the age range (i.e., 70 years or older). Comparisons between younger and older HIV-infected populations or comparisons between older HIV-infected individuals and their age-matched non-HIV-infected counterparts are appropriate.\n     \n \n \n      Attention to geriatric outcomes:\n      \n     In addition to traditional important outcomes of HIV/AIDS research (e.g., viral load, survival), studies are encouraged to also include outcomes considered important in geriatric medicine and gerontology, such as physical and cognitive function, quality of life measures, and social support.\n     \n \n \n      Leveraging existing resources where possible:\n      \n     A variety of NIH-funded resources are available to study HIV in aging, such as longitudinal studies of HIV-infected individuals and/or their non-infected counterparts (observational or interventional), clinical networks, and research centers. Leveraging such resources through secondary analyses of available data, ancillary studies, or utilization of existing infrastructure are cost-effective approaches to testing hypotheses or generating relevant data for further studies. Please see OAR's quick reference guide on\n      \n      HIV and Aging Efforts Across NIH\n      \n     for a detailed list of relevant resources and cohort studies.\n     \n \n \n      Selection of appropriate controls\n      \n \n      :\n      \n     Aging individuals living with HIV have varied and complex clinical pictures. Biological and psychological co-morbidities, treatment regimens, lifestyle and behavioral factors, socioeconomic factors, and social support may all impact disease development, coping, and progression. This complexity presents a significant challenge to identifying appropriate control populations in observational studies of aging individuals with HIV. Such studies should include adequate justification for selection of the proposed control group(s).\n     \n \n \n      Characterization of phenotypes:\n      \n     Several biological or behavioral phenotypes of HIV in aging that have been elucidated may have markedly different disease courses, biological underpinnings, and treatment responses. Such phenotypes may be described by characteristics like frailty/disability, accelerated aging, successful aging, or other descriptors. Investigators are encouraged to maximize the homogeneity of subgroups by defining specific phenotypes in analyses.\n     \n \n \n      Exploratory/Developmental nature:\n      \n     New directions that expand or shift existing paradigms are needed to advance the science of HIV and aging. Studies that move the science into new directions with little or no preliminary data are appropriate for this mechanism.\n     \n \n \n    Interests of Specific Institutes/Centers/Offices\n    \n \n    Supporting multidisciplinary studies of HIV/AIDS and aging is consistent with the mission of multiple NIH\u00a0 Institutes, Centers, and Offices (ICOs)\n    . Below are the specific research interests of the majority of ICOs participating in this NOFO.\n    \n \n \n \n      Applicants are strongly encouraged to contact the ICO\u2019s Scientific/Research contact listed in Section VII. Agency Contacts of this NOFO\n      \n \n \n \n      prior to submission of an application\n      \n \n \n \n      to discuss the research interest of a specific ICO.\n      \n \n \n \n \n     National Institute on Aging (\n     \n \n \n      NIA\n      \n \n \n     )\n     \n \n \n    NIA is interested in understanding how biological, clinical, and socio-behavioral processes affect older individuals with HIV and their caregivers, and the social, economic, and health consequences of HIV. Example topics include the following:\n    \n \n \n     Interactions among aging-related genetic, molecular, cellular, and physiological changes with HIV risk, infection, and pathogenesis.\n     \n \n     Interactions among individual-level factors and interpersonal, social, and structural factors, and their contributions to the physical, psychological, and economic well-being of individuals; and interactions among HIV/AIDS, other disease, and population aging, particularly in low-income areas such as low-income areas of sub-Saharan Africa.\n     \n \n     Interactions among HIV infection, treatment, and development or progression of cognitive decline\u00a0(HIV-associated neurocognitive decline (HAND), dementia, and other disabilities in older adults.\n     \n \n     Interactions of HIV infection and treatment with other aging-related diseases, conditions, and syndromes and geriatrics-informed approaches to assessment and management of older adults with HIV.\n     \n \n \n \n     National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (\n     \n \n \n      NIAAA\n      \n \n \n     )\n     \n \n \n    Alcohol use disorders (AUD) are prevalent among PLWH. Consequently, PLWH and AUD are known to experience the common adverse health effects of alcohol use (organ and tissue injury and accidents such as falls) and comorbid psychological conditions (e.g., depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress, and pain). How these alcohol-related health problems and comorbidities, individually or in combination, progress as individuals age is complex and still poorly understood. In addition, alcohol use and viral expression and associated immunological responses, including progressive dysregulation of the immune system, may have additive or synergistic effects on the progression of aging.\u00a0Among individuals who drink, even treated HIV can be associated with accelerated aging, possibly from treatment sequelae or legacy effects, and notably from AUD comorbidity. Improved biomarker measurement may facilitate a more complete understanding of the mechanisms underlying accelerated aging in the context of alcohol-related comorbid conditions. In general, alcohol exposure, hazardous (and harmful) patterns of use, and AUD diagnosis are associated with different types of functional impairment (e.g., frailty). Improved management of alcohol use could lead to improved fulfillment of social roles, as well as improved HIV-related health outcomes over the lifespan. Further research is needed to take into account the important relationships between patterns of alcohol use and HIV treatment and care outcomes among PLWH as they age. Supported studies may include, but are not limited to:\n    \n \n \n     Addressing the important relationships between patterns of alcohol use and HIV treatment and care outcomes among PLWH as they age, including the development and application of innovative adaptive intervention strategies and implementation research to inform efforts to bring evidence-based interventions to population scale.\n     \n \n \n \n     National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (\n     \n \n \n      NIAMS\n      \n \n \n     )\n     \n \n \n    NIAMS encourages studies focused on the following:\n    \n \n \n     Observational, biopsychosocial/behavioral, translational, basic/pre-clinical/clinical research, and mechanistic clinical trials focused on how the process of aging in the presence or treatment of HIV/AIDS impacts diseases within the NIAMS core mission, which are more common among the aging population (e.g., rheumatologic disorders, bone fractures, osteoporosis, osteoarthritis).\n     \n \n     Interdisciplinary research aimed at elucidating factors that may drive the aging population living with HIV/AIDS to develop NIAMS mission-related diseases and understanding how the interplay between aging and HIV/AIDS may promote the acceleration or worsening of these diseases.\n     \n \n \n    NIAMS will not support applications proposing clinical trials submitted in response to this NOFO. Clinical trials instead should be submitted to a NIAMS clinical trial-specific funding opportunity (see\u00a0NIAMS'\n     \n     Investigator-Initiated Clinical Research\n     \n    web page).\u00a0Consultation with NIAMS staff is strongly recommended for investigators planning a clinical trial with a mechanistic outcome.

Specifically, NIDCR encourages research investigating how the process of aging impacts the presence or treatment of HIV-associated oral comorbidities, co-infections, and complications (CCCs) in the context of PLWH. NIDCR will not support applications proposing clinical trials submitted in response to this NOFO.

In the context of HIV disease, NINDS is particularly interested in the neurological complications of HIV infection that affect the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nervous system. For the purposes of this NOFO, specific topics of interest might include (but would not be limited to):\n    \n \n \n     The long-term consequences of latent HIV in the CNS as it pertains to the modulation of chronic neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment in aging; the mechanisms by which chronic HIV exacerbates long-term blood-brain barrier damage and cerebrovascular dysfunction.\n     \n \n     Studies of the mechanisms by which chronic HIV primes the CNS for neurodegeneration, including in the context of AD/ADRD and other age-associated neurodegenerative disorders.\n     \n \n     The long-term effect of chronic antiretroviral therapy (ART) exposure throughout the lifespan on the central and peripheral nervous systems.\n     \n \n     Mechanisms of HIV-associated peripheral neuropathy and chronic pain in aged individuals; and studies that address the question of whether chronic HIV infection and exposure to ART cause accelerated aging of the CNS.\n     \n \n \n    While NINDS will support studies focused on the effect of chronic HIV on cognitive outcomes in the setting of neurological disease,\n     \n     applications that are solely interested in mental health and psychiatric outcomes will not be supported by NINDS\n     \n    . This includes applications that solely rely upon RDoC-based constructs for neurobehavioral analyses. Rather, NINDS strongly prefers the incorporation of additional multidimensional measures of neurological function, such as NIH Toolbox and Neuro-QOL -based assessments of cognitive, motor, and sensory function. In addition, only mechanistic clinical trials and Basic Experimental Studies with Humans (BESH) will be supported by NINDS under this funding opportunity. Clinical trials that seek to answer specific questions about safety, tolerability, clinical efficacy, effectiveness, clinical management, and/or implementation of pharmacologic, behavioral, biologic, surgical, or device (invasive or non-invasive) interventions\n     \n     will not be supported under this NOFO\n     \n    Rather, such projects should be submitted to one of NINDS\u2019 clinical trial-specific funding announcements (such as\n     \n     PAR-22-142\n     \n    or\n     \n     PAR-21-237\n     \n    ).\n    \n \n    NINDS urges investigators to follow the\n     \n     NIH guidance for rigor and transparency in grant applications\n     \n    and additionally recommends the research practices described on\n     \n     NINDS' resource web page on preparing\n      \n      applications\n      \n \n \n \n    to ensure that robust experiments are designed, potential experimenter biases are minimized, results and analyses are transparently reported, and results are interpreted carefully. These recommended research practices include, where applicable: rationale for the chosen model(s) and primary/secondary endpoints, clear descriptions of tools and parameters, blinding, randomization, ensuring adequate sample size, pre-specified inclusion/exclusion criteria, handling of missing data and outliers, appropriate controls, preplanned analyses, appropriate quantitative techniques, clear indication of exploratory vs. confirmatory components of the study, consideration of limitations, and plans for transparent reporting of all methods, analyses, and results so that other investigators can evaluate the quality of the work and potentially perform replications.\n    \n \n \n     National Cancer Institute (\n     \n \n \n      NCI\n      \n \n \n     )\n     \n \n \n    Recent data indicates an increase in a variety of cancer types (e.g., anus, liver, oral cavity/pharynx, lung, and Hodgkin lymphoma), which is driven primarily by the growth and aging of PLWH who are on highly effective antiretroviral therapy. Aging is, by itself, a key factor promoting the development of many cancers, and HIV infection can itself cause certain manifestations of premature aging. There is a lack of data on the interplay between aging, HIV, long-term exposure to antiretroviral drugs, and other factors promoting cancer development in PLWH who are aging. In addition, there is little understanding of the interplay between host factors and immune perturbations that occur in aging and how these interactions affect cancers that are mostly seen in older people (e.g., clonal hematopoiesis and biological aging). \u00a0Therefore, NCI is interested in applications proposing studies on the following:\n    \n \n \n     Research studies to help understand how aging in the presence of chronic HIV infection affects the risk, spectrum, and biology of cancer in PLWH.\n     \n \n     Cancer treatment outcomes and survivorship in PLWH.\n     \n \n \n \n     Office of Research on Women's Health (\n     \n \n \n      ORWH\n      \n \n \n     )\n     \n \n \n    ORWH is part of NIH's Office of the Director.

Notice of Funding Opportunity Description PAR-25-374: Translational Bioinformatics and Experimental Approaches to Advance Drug Repositioning and Combination Therapy Development for Alzheimers Disease and Related Dementias (R01 Clinical Trial Not Allowed) Section I. Notice of Funding Opportunity Description\n    \n \n \n \n \n     Background\n     \n \n \n    Drug repurposing has several advantages over the development of new drugs including, shorter development times, lesser cost of development, and higher success rates. This has been done successfully for several disease conditions, however, despite multiple attempts at drug repurposing for Alzheimer's disease (AD) or AD-related dementias (ADRD) treatment, these have been without success. As we learn about the enormous complexity of AD pathophysiology and associated co-morbid conditions, it is becoming apparent that efficacious treatment for an individual patient will need to target multiple aspects of the disease and be directed towards several pathogenic processes and, as a result, require development of combination therapies.\n    \n \n    The promise and challenges to successful drug repurposing and combination therapy development for AD were one of the major topics of discussion at the NIH AD Research Summits of\n     \n     2012\n     \n    ,\n     \n     2015,\n     \n    and\n     \n     2018\n     \n    and\n     \n     2021\n     \n    . A series of recommendations were generated from the summit discussions that called for establishing new research programs that will promote the use of systems-based, data-driven approaches to create the biomedical knowledge base, tools, and resources needed for successful drug repurposing and repositioning and combination therapy development for AD/ADRD. In 2017, NIA launched the funding initiative\n     \n     PAR-17-032\n     \n    \u201c\n     \n     Translational Bioinformatics Approaches to Advance Drug Repositioning and Combination Therapy Development for Alzheimer\u2019s Disease\u201d\n     \n    , (reissued in 2020 as\n     \n     PAR-20-156\n     \n    ).  The projects funded through this initiative led to the establishment of NIA's\n     \n     Advancing Combination Therapy and Drug Repurposing for Alzheimer\u2019s Disease\n     \n    (ACTDRx AD) program. ACTDRx AD is a\n     \n     cross-disciplinary program\n     \n    using translational bioinformatics approaches to formulate hypotheses and identify drug candidates (individually or in combination) that may be efficacious for the treatment of AD/ADRD. The program has brought investigators working on other chronic disorders with deep expertise in data science and multiscale modeling into AD/ADRD research. Cutting edge computational methods, including artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches, have facilitated the identification of hundreds of potentially repurposable drugs. However, there remains a need to prioritize the most promising drug candidates through additional computational approaches and through rigorous and reproducible preclinical testing in mouse models or cell-based models to evaluate their PK/PD properties and efficacy against multiple AD/ADRD outcomes (molecular, biochemical, neuropathologic, functional).\n    \n \n    This new iteration of\n    the program will build on NIA\u2019s investment in data-driven approaches to AD drug repurposing and combination therapy development. This initiative is envisioned to expand current efforts with a focus on prioritization of drug candidates for repurposing and repositioning (as individual treatment or in combination with other drug candidates or non-pharmacologic interventions) and on rigorous, reproducible preclinical proof-of-concept studies in mouse models or cell-based models of AD/ADRD.\n    \n \n \n     Research Objectives\n     \n \n \n    The overarching goal of this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) is to support rigorous preclinical testing of drug candidates that have been identified through data-driven approaches for repositioning, repurposing, and combination therapy for t reatment and prevention of\n    AD/ADRD. This NOFO solicits R01 applications that will conduct rigorous proof-of-concept studies using mouse models of AD/ADRD or cell-based models (such as iPSCs and organodis), to prioritize and test drugs or drug combinations  predicted to be efficacious in AD/ADRD treatment and/or prevention\n    . This initiative will also support preclinical testing of repurposable or investigational drug candidates in combination with non-pharmacologic interventions leading to robust translational outcomes.\n    \n \n    Drugs to be tested could be FDA-approved drugs being currently used for other indications and  investigational drugs that are at various stages of clinical development (for AD/ADRD or other conditions),\n    including candidate drugs from failed Phase II/Phase III clinical trials, that have been predicted to be efficacious for the treatment and prevention of AD/ADRD. Of particular interest is robust preclinical testing of prioritized drug candidates that have been identified through NIA\u2019s ACTDRx AD program in response to funding initiatives\n     \n     PAR-17-032\n     \n    and\n     \n     PAR-20-156\n     \n    . Additionally, o f specific interest are projects that leverage the network concept of drug targets to advance rational drug repurposing based on the ability of single or multiple therapeutic agents to perturb entire molecular networks away from disease states in animal models and/or cell-based models (e.g., iPSCs, organoids etc.)\n    .\n    \n \n    A\n    cademic/industry partnerships are encouraged where industry partners provide failed Phase II/III compounds and biosamples from legacy trials to enable drug repositioning and combination therapy analyses. Additionally, applicants are strongly encouraged to partner with academic and/or industry researchers with prior experience in preclinical drug development for neurodegenerative diseases.\n    \n \n    Applications in the following categories are particularly invited, although these do not exhaust the possible approaches to drug repositioning and combination therapy development for AD/ ADRD:\n    \n \n \n     Conducting preclinical studies to establish evidence of efficacy, synergy, toxicity, target engagement, mechanism of action, route of administration, dose range, schedule of administration for repurposed drug/drug combination in relevant mouse-model systems or cell-based model systems.\n     \n \n     Testing individual drugs or drug combinations to evaluate efficacy and toxicity, including combining current disease treatment with a repurposed treatment or combining multiple repurposed therapies.\n     \n \n     Testing candidate drugs in blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability studies.\n     \n \n     Testing potential synergies and/or adverse events of individual drugs or drug combinations in relevant disease models.\n     \n \n     Assessment of PK/PD properties through the generation of multi-omic molecular data (i.e., transcriptional, epigenomic, proteomic and metabolomic) that will enable systems-level analyses to determine mechanism of action of putative drugs/drug combinations; and provide evidence that the drugs modulate disease relevant pathways/networks in preclinical/ mouse models and / or cell-based models.\n     \n \n     Development of quantitative, mechanistic methods that can assess the synergy or additivity of candidate therapeutics, including synergy between candidate drugs and non-pharmacological perturbations (i.e. exercise, diet, sleep, cognitive training).\n     \n \n \n    Applications should propose a streamlined preclinical testing strategy with go/no-go decision points that allow critical and unbiased assessment of therapeutic agents leading to robust translational outcomes. Projects should bring together relevant technologies and a multidisciplinary team of scientists with necessary expertise including in animal models of AD, network biology, disease biology, biostatistics, PK/PD modeling, pharmacology, and clinical research to design assays and develop tools and methods that enable prioritization and rigorous testing of candidate drugs.\n    \n \n    All preclinical efficacy testing studies should be conducted and reported in compliance with\n     \n     NIH guidance on rigor and reproducibility\n     \n    . Particularly, the preclinical efficacy studies are expected to follow the\n     \n     general ARRIVE guidelines for animal research\n     \n    and the\n     \n     best practice guidelines for AD preclinical efficacy studies\n     \n    .

Multidisciplinary teams of scientists and clinicians must focus on generating preclinical data that will lead to the development of biological, pharmacological, medical device and/or combination product interventions. The ultimate goal of this program is to make new technological, biological and pharmacological resources available to clinicians and their patients.\n    \n \n    The steps towards this goal should be clearly delineated in a series of milestones that support the development of a therapeutic or device that will lead to an Investigational New Drug (IND) or Investigational Device Exception (IDE) application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and/or testing in a clinical trial.\n    \n \n    This NOFO will utilize a bi-phasic, milestone-driven mechanism of award. The R61 phase will support research that has demonstrated significant preliminary data but has not advanced to the level of clinical translation. \u00a0The R33 phase will support research that is in the final states of preclinical development with potential for near-term clinical development. \u00a0Support for a single phased award that does not need the R61 Exploratory phase is available in the companion R33,\n     \n     PAR-23-205\n     \n    .\n     \n \n \n \n   Funding Opportunity Goal(s)\n    \n    1) To support eye and vision research projects that address the leading causes of blindness and impaired vision in the U.S. These include retinal diseases; corneal diseases; cataract; glaucoma and optic neuropathies; strabismus; amblyopia; and low vision and blindness rehabilitation. 2) To increase understanding of the normal development and function of the visual system in order to better prevent, diagnose, and treat sight-threatening conditions; and, to enhance the rehabilitation, training, and quality of life of individuals who are partially-sighted or blind. 3) To support a broad program of basic vision research through grants and cooperative agreements; to encourage high quality clinical research, including clinical trials, other epidemiological studies, and health services research; to encourage research training and career development in the sciences related to vision; and to sponsor scientific workshops in high priority research areas to encourage exchange of information among scientists.\n    \n This variable defines that we need to start a new row.", "0c9447c9-9fd0-48ab-a510-2a91810371b9": "Expired PAR-25-335: NEI Translational Research Program for Therapeutics (R61/R33 Clinical Trial Not Allowed) Key Dates Expired PAR-25-335: NEI Translational Research Program for Therapeutics (R61/R33 Clinical Trial Not Allowed) Key Dates\n    \n \n \n   Posted Date\n   January 07, 2025\n    \n \n   Open Date (Earliest Submission Date)\n   January 16, 2025\n    \n \n   Letter of Intent Due Date(s)\n    \n    January 16, 2025\n    \n This variable defines that we need to start a new row.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       Application Due Dates\n       \n \n       Review and Award Cycles\n       \n \n \n \n       New\n       \n \n       Renewal / Resubmission / Revision (as allowed)\n       \n \n       AIDS - New/Renewal/Resubmission/Revision, as allowed\n       \n \n       Scientific Merit Review\n       \n \n       Advisory Council Review\n       \n \n       Earliest Start Date\n       \n \n \n \n \n \n       February 16, 2025\n       \n \n       March 16, 2025\n       \n \n       Not Applicable\n       \n \n       June 2025\n       \n \n       October 2025\n       \n \n       December 2025\n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    All applications are due by 5:00 PM local time of applicant organization.\n    \n \n    Applicants are encouraged to apply early to allow adequate time to make any corrections to errors found in the application during the submission process by the due date.\n    \n \n \n   Expiration Date\n   March 17, 2025\n    \n \n   Due Dates for E.O. 12372\n    \n    Not Applicable\n    \n This variable defines that we need to start a new row.  \n \n \n   Required Application Instructions\n    \n    It is critical that applicants follow the instructions in the Research (R) Instructions in the\n     \n     How to Apply - Application Guide\n     \n    , except where instructed to do otherwise (in this NOFO or in a Notice from\n     \n     NIH Guide for Grants and Contracts\n     \n    ).\n    \n \n    Conformance to all requirements (both in the Application Guide and the NOFO) is required and strictly enforced.

Notice of Funding Opportunity Description Expired PAR-25-335: NEI Translational Research Program for Therapeutics (R61/R33 Clinical Trial Not Allowed) Section I. Notice of Funding Opportunity Description\n    \n \n \n \n \n     Research Objectives\n     \n \n \n    The mission of the National Eye Institute (NEI) is to eliminate vision loss and improve quality of life through vision research. The NEI invites applications for research that aligns with our\n     \n     strategic plan\n     \n    . \u00a0 The purpose of this program is to accelerate the development of biological, pharmacological, medical device, and/or combination product interventions for clinicians to use in the treatment of visual system diseases and disorders.\u00a0 In the context of this program, the PD/PI assembles a multi-disciplinary research team that employs an integrative approach to the rapid and efficient translation of laboratory research findings into IND or IDE applications to the FDA for testing new therapeutic approaches. The collaborative teams must include as appropriate, non-clinical and clinical scientists, disease experts, regulatory experts, bioethics specialists, experts in manufacturing under Quality Systems and Design Controls, and other relevant academic, clinical, and/or industry experts.\n    \n \n    This program is not intended to support solely basic science, platform technologies or isolated technology development. The goal is to produce preclinical data that will support an IND or IDE application to the FDA. Each project must have a well-defined end point, of developing a new device or treatment for a specific ocular disease that is achievable within a five-year time frame. The steps towards this goal should be clearly delineated in a series of milestones that support the development of a therapeutic or device that can be tested in a clinical trial.\n    \n \n \n     Structure\n     \n \n \n    This NOFO will utilize a bi-phasic, milestone-driven R61/R33 mechanism consisting of an Exploratory phase (R61) and a Developmental phase (R33). Applicants must address objectives for both a R61 and a R33 phase and are strongly encouraged to use project management principles as appropriate.\n    \n \n \n     Phases of Award\n     \n \n \n    Applicants are strongly encouraged to consult with relevant agency staff prior to developing and submitting an application (see Agency Contacts, Section VII). Early contact with NEI Staff (at least 12 weeks prior to submission) is encouraged. This period of time provides an opportunity for NEI staff to discuss the scope and goals, and to provide information and guidance to the applicants.\n    \n \n \n     The R61 Phase:\n     \n \n \n    The R61 phase can be up to two years and will support research that has demonstrated significant preliminary data but has not advanced to the level of clinical translation.\n    \n \n    Examples of activities that can be supported during the Exploratory (R61) stage include, but are not limited to:\n    \n \n \n     Refine device design as necessary for subsequent GLP testing or additional clinical studies for regulatory approval\n     \n \n     Bench-top and animal testing to demonstrate compliance with FDA Recognized Standards\n     \n \n     Optimize a promising lead agent\n     \n \n     Optimization and/or qualification of appropriate assays for pharmacokinetic, target engagement markers, biodistribution, or other assays to monitor safety available to be used in the R33 phase\n     \n \n     Determination of optimal route of administration\n     \n \n     Lead optimization to improve effectiveness, diminish toxicity, and increase absorption (e.g., absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME)\n     \n \n     Demonstration of adequate/stage-appropriate preliminary safety, such as safety pharmacology and/or dose-range finding toxicology\n     \n \n     Regulatory activities, including pre-submission meetings with FDA\n     \n \n \n    An administrative review of the extent to which peer-reviewed milestones are met in the R61 phase will determine whether the R33 phase award will be issued, subject to NEI funding availability.\n    \n \n \n     The R33 Phase:\n     \n \n \n    The R33 phase can be up to three years and will support research that is in the final states of preclinical development with potential for near-term clinical development. The R33 is to focus on advancing a single therapeutic candidate through IND/IDE -enabling studies, filing an IND/IDE package with the FDA, and designing future clinical trials.\u00a0 R33 recipients must submit or obtain an Investigational New Drug/Investigational Device Exemption (IND/IDE) application to FDA, or must transition the product to clinical practice, within the period of performance.\u00a0 The specific activities appropriate for the R33 phase will depend on the product under study and available preliminary data on the product.\n    \n \n    Examples of activities that can be supported during the Developmental (R33) stage include, but are not limited to:\n    \n \n \n     cGMP manufacturing of material for IND-enabling and/or Phase I clinical testing\n     \n \n     IND/IDE-enabling safety pharmacology and toxicology studies to determine a basis for clinical dose extrapolation using a relevant animal model\n     \n \n     IND/IDE document preparation and filing with the FDA\n     \n \n \n \n     Milestones\n     \n \n \n    Delineation of milestones by the applicant for the R61 and R33 phases is a key characteristic of this NOFO. A milestone is defined as a scheduled event in the project timeline that signifies the completion of a major project stage or activity. This NOFO will support applications that propose a series of milestones including manufacturing and product development goals.\n     \n     Applications that address contingency plans to proactively confront potential delays in meeting the milestones are strongly encouraged.\n     \n    Proposed projects must include both an R61 phase with milestone-driven developmental activities, and an R33 phase with milestone-driven expanded activities that will build on the initial R61 exploratory phase to achieve the aims of the entire award. Milestones are required for both phases. Milestones must be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).\n    \n \n    Applications that only propose R61 or R33 activities will be considered incomplete and will not be accepted to this NOFO.\u00a0 Support for a single phased award that does not need the R61 Exploratory phase is available in the companion R33,\n     \n     PAR-23-205\n     \n    .\n    \n \n    Prior to funding an application, program staff will contact the applicant to discuss the proposed milestones. The Program Director and the applicant will negotiate and agree on a final set of milestones. These will be incorporated into the terms and conditions of the award and will be the basis for judging the success of the R61 work.\n    \n \n    Satisfactory completion of R61 milestones will be assessed administratively by NEI to determine eligibility to transition to the R33 phase.\u00a0 As determined by NEI, R33 projects that must be substantially modified because of FDA pre-IND/IDE guidance will be required to submit a new competing R33.\n     \n     Pre-Submission feedback from the FDA is a required R61 milestone.\n     \n \n \n \n     Non-Responsiveness Criteria\n     \n \n \n    The following types of applications will be considered non-responsive and will be withdrawn prior to review:\n    \n \n \n     Applications that do not address the NEI mission and\n      \n      Strategic Plan\n      \n \n \n     Applications that do not propose R61 and R33 milestones as well as a clear demarcation of which activities are expected to be accomplished in the R61 phase and which are expected during the R33 phase.\n     \n \n     Applications that propose development of research infrastructure\n     \n \n     Clinical Trials are not supported by this NOFO including:\n     \n \n     Phase I (first-in-human) trials\n     \n \n     Observational studies that do not meet the NIH definition of a clinical trial\n     \n \n     Multi-site trials\n     \n \n     Drug or device safety trials\n     \n \n     Basic Experimental Studies in Humans (BESH)\n     \n \n \n \n \n    See\n     \n     Section VIII.

Notice of Funding Opportunity Description PAR-25-362: Early Immune System Development and Ontogeny (R01 Clinical Trial Optional) Section I. Notice of Funding Opportunity Description\n    \n \n \n \n \n     Purpose\n     \n \n \n    The purpose of this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) is to\u00a0further elucidate\n     \n \n      the mechanisms of early immune development in utero, during the early post-natal period and during early childhood in neonates, infants, and children and adolescents with or without in-utero exposure to HIV or Anti-Retroviral Therapeutics (ART).\n      \n \n    This initiative aims to understand intricate mechanisms of immune cells at the maternal-fetal interface, T and B cell development and maturation in offspring, and local immune responses and the role of systemic immunity.\n    \n \n \n     Background\n     \n \n \n    The global mortality rate of children under the age of 5 has declined by over 55% in the last two decades. However, improving survival of infants and neonates remains of concern predominantly due to infectious diseases and immune modulations. The pediatric immune system is remarkably different from the adult immune system - forming the basis for overall well-being and an adequate disease encountering status into adulthood. A protected and systematically trained pediatric immune system results in a robust and efficient adult immune system. Moreover, immune system in children responds strongly, rapidly and robustly in comparison to the adult immune system to immunization, diet, and environmental factors.\n    \n \n    Chronic maternal and paternal infections such as HIV and associated co-infections or co-Morbidities are critical in determining the development of the immune system starting in-utero that can later dictate immune responses as late as adolescence.\n    \n \n    The research focus in the current announcement is multi-disciplinary but must be in the context of chronic maternal and paternal infections, specifically HIV and associated co-Morbidities. The goals of this NOFO are to study the areas of immune ontogeny and development in the offspring, the mechanisms of infant and neonatal immunity, and the relationship between ontogeny of immunosuppression, alteration(s) due to exposure to long-acting or other anti-retroviral medication (ARVs), maternal and paternal\n     \n \n    genetic and immunologic factors that cause or act as precursors of impaired immune responses in offspring.\n    \n \n \n     Research Scope\n     \n \n \n    The over-arching scope of this NOFO is: to\u00a0study development of early immune system within the context of HIV and developmental patterns associated with maternal and paternal immune status to understand immune ontogeny with additional focus on the microbiome and/or ARVs, and co-infections or co-Morbidities including diet, metabolism and obesity.\n    \n \n    Further, the scope can be covered under these following topics and is not limited to:\n    \n \n \n     Study maternal and paternal immune status and impact on development of the immune system in infants, children and adolescents, specifically differentiation, maturation and suppression of T and B lymphocytes, development of mucosal immune system, secondary lymphoid organs (Peyer's patches, tonsils etc.) and differential organ-specific vs central immunity.\n     \n \n     Impact(s) of parental DNA methylation patterns guiding outcomes such as HIV disease progression and immune regulation by epigenetic modulation and genomic aging patterns in offspring.\n     \n \n     Characterize the role of maternal fetal interface in influencing immune imprinting in-utero and its contribution towards the development of a robust immune system using novel technologies (scRNAseq, single cell imaging, cytometric profiling etc.).\n     \n \n     Delineate role of background immunization in early life or exposure to immuno-prophylaxis or immuno-therapeutics and their impact on sustained immune responses in pediatric populations.\n     \n \n     Elements of immune system exchanged in utero and their association with the development of autoimmune diseases during the life-course.\n     \n \n \n \n     The following are projects that will be considered non-responsive and will not be reviewed:\n     \n \n \n \n     Applications proposing vaccine advocacy.\n     \n \n     Applications proposing to focus exclusively on effects of microbiome and not studying the relevance of these effects on infectious diseases or early immune system development.\n     \n \n     Applications proposing to focus exclusively on epigenomic approaches.\n     \n \n     Applications focusing on immunization strategies in infants for altering early immune responses.\n     \n \n \n \n     Because this list of topics is not meant to be all-inclusive, applicants are\n      \n      STRONGLY ENCOURAGED\n      \n     to discuss program relevance with the Scientific/Research Contact indicated in Section VII.

Additional Information on Eligibility.\n    \n \n \n   Assistance Listing Number(s)\n   93.173\n    \n \n   Funding Opportunity Purpose\n    \n    This funding opportunity aims to support the development of\n     \n     in vivo\n     \n    high-resolution structural and functional imaging technologies for the living human inner ear. Proposed projects should focus on improving the resolution of current imaging techniques or developing new imaging techniques that can visualize inner ear structures\n     \n     in vivo\n     \n    with significantly greater detail and accuracy than currently possible. Both structural and functional aspects, including visualizing dynamic elements are important to the development of new and improved techniques. Projects may also focus on developing new imaging probes or contrast agents that can enhance visualization of the inner ear structures. Research supported in response to this funding opportunity is expected to significantly advance the ability to visualize auditory and vestibular components, such as hair cells, otoliths, membranes, ions, and vasculature, in detail in awake patients in a clinical setting using non-invasive techniques. To achieve this goal, a multidisciplinary team approach that takes advantage of the expertise of each team member is highly encouraged.\u00a0Studies in humans and intermediate studies in mammalian animal models may be proposed to develop or advance the needed technology. Any intermediate studies must articulate a clear path of the proposed methodology to application in awake humans or define the limitations and the usefulness in anesthetized humans.\n    \n \n    This notice of funding opportunity announcement (NOFO) also supports investigator initiated low-risk clinical trials addressing the development or improvement of human\n     \n     in vivo\n     \n    structural and functional imaging technologies.\u00a0Clinical trials must meet ALL the following criteria: meet the budget limits of this NOFO, not require FDA oversight, not be an NIH-defined Phase III Clinical Trial, have low risks to subjects, and intend to gather scientific data/evidence to inform subsequent studies. This NOFO also supports low-risk trials determined to be Basic Experimental Studies with Humans (\n     \n     BESH\n     \n    ). These studies fall within the NIH definition of a clinical trial and meet the definition of basic research. Only one clinical trial is allowed in each application. High-risk clinical trials not meeting all the criteria above are referred to the companion U01 Cooperative Agreement for\n     \n     In Vivo\n     \n    High-Resolution Imaging for Inner Ear Visualization (Clinical Trial required) NOFO\n     \n     RFA-DC-25-003\n     \n    .\n    \n \n \n   Funding Opportunity Goal(s)\n    \n    To investigate solutions to problems directly relevant to individuals with deafness or disorders of human communication in the areas of hearing, balance, smell, taste, voice, speech, and language. The National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD) supports research and research training, including investigation into the etiology, pathology, detection, treatment, and prevention of disorders of hearing and other communication processes, primarily through the support of basic and applied research in anatomy, audiology, biochemistry, bioengineering, epidemiology, genetics, immunology, microbiology, molecular biology, the neurosciences, otolaryngology, psychology, pharmacology, physiology, psychophysics, speech-language pathology, and other scientific disciplines. The NIDCD supports: (1) Research into the evaluation of techniques and devices used in diagnosis, treatment, rehabilitation, and prevention of disorders of hearing and other communication processes; (2) research into prevention and early detection and diagnosis of hearing loss and speech, voice, and language disorders and research into preventing the effects of such disorders by means of appropriate referral and rehabilitation; (3) research into the detection, treatment, and prevention of disorders of hearing and other communication processes in the elderly population and its rehabilitation to ensure continued effective communication skills; and (4) research to expand knowledge of the effects of environmental agents that influence hearing or other communication processes.\n    \n This variable defines that we need to start a new row.", "16fb3401-5213-48f6-996d-d28b7606cafd": "RFA-DC-25-005: In Vivo High-Resolution Imaging for Inner Ear Visualization (R01 Clinical Trial optional) Key Dates RFA-DC-25-005: In Vivo High-Resolution Imaging for Inner Ear Visualization (R01 Clinical Trial optional) Key Dates\n    \n \n \n   Posted Date\n   January 06, 2025\n    \n \n   Open Date (Earliest Submission Date)\n   May 03, 2025\n    \n \n   Letter of Intent Due Date(s)\n    \n    30 days prior to the application due date.\n    \n This variable defines that we need to start a new row.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       Application Due Dates\n       \n \n       Review and Award Cycles\n       \n \n \n \n       New\n       \n \n       Renewal / Resubmission / Revision (as allowed)\n       \n \n       AIDS - New/Renewal/Resubmission/Revision, as allowed\n       \n \n       Scientific Merit Review\n       \n \n       Advisory Council Review\n       \n \n       Earliest Start Date\n       \n \n \n \n \n \n       June 03, 2025\n       \n \n       June 03, 2025\n       \n \n       Not Applicable\n       \n \n       November 2025\n       \n \n       January 2026\n       \n \n       March 2026\n       \n \n \n \n       October 01, 2025\n       \n \n       October 01, 2025\n       \n \n       Not Applicable\n       \n \n       March 2026\n       \n \n       May 2026\n       \n \n       July 2026\n       \n \n \n \n       June 03, 2026\n       \n \n       June 03, 2026\n       \n \n       Not Applicable\n       \n \n       November 2026\n       \n \n       January 2027\n       \n \n       March 2027\n       \n \n \n \n       October 01, 2026\n       \n \n       October 01, 2026\n       \n \n       Not Applicable\n       \n \n       March 2027\n       \n \n       May 2027\n       \n \n       July 2027\n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    All applications are due by 5:00 PM local time of applicant organization.\n    \n \n    Applicants are encouraged to apply early to allow adequate time to make any corrections to errors found in the application during the submission process by the due date.\n    \n \n \n \n    No late applications will be accepted for this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO).\n    \n \n \n   Expiration Date\n   October 02, 2026\n    \n \n   Due Dates for E.O. 12372\n    \n    Not Applicable\n    \n This variable defines that we need to start a new row.  \n \n \n   Required Application Instructions\n    \n    It is critical that applicants follow the instructions in the Research (R) Instructions in the\n     \n     How to Apply - Application Guide\n     \n    , except where instructed to do otherwise (in this NOFO or in a Notice from\n     \n     NIH Guide for Grants and Contracts\n     \n    ).\n    \n \n    Conformance to all requirements (both in the Application Guide and the NOFO) is required and strictly enforced.

Notice of Funding Opportunity Description RFA-DC-25-005: In Vivo High-Resolution Imaging for Inner Ear Visualization (R01 Clinical Trial optional) Section I. Notice of Funding Opportunity Description\n    \n \n \n \n \n     Background:\n     \n    The inner ear is a complex and delicate sensory organ responsible for hearing and balance. The anatomy of the human inner ear, including the small size of the sensory structures and their deep location within the temporal bone, poses significant challenges for imaging this organ. While various imaging modalities exist, none currently provide sufficient resolution to fully visualize the inner ear structures, nor do technologies exist that produce images in sufficient detail for fine-grade distinctions of inner ear components in living human tissue. Such imaging is needed to improve the diagnosis and treatment of inner ear disorders.\n    \n \n    While NIDCD has a significant investment in human post-mortem tissue to study the cochlea and vestibular system, detailed, non-invasive imaging in living humans has been severely impeded due to the limitations of current technology. These restrictions have seriously hampered progress in understanding pathology of the organs of hearing and balance in humans. The critical need to relate findings from animal models to human ear disorders, and for formulating specific diagnoses and treatment plans through the detailed visualization of the human inner ear has been emphasized in both a past NIDCD workshop \u201cVisualizing the Human Inner Ear\u201d (\n     \n     https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/research/workshops/visualizing-human-inner-ear-workshop/2019/summary\n     \n    )\u00a0and the current NIDCD Strategic Plan for 2023-2027 (\n     \n     https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/about/strategic-plans\n     \n    ). In addition, in 2023, NIDCD\n    issued a Request for Information (RFI) inviting input regarding NIDCD\u2019s support of non-invasive imaging in humans (\n     \n     https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-DC-23-004.html\n     \n    ).\n    Throughout these activities, the need for high-quality, high-resolution imaging of the human inner ear was a strong and recurrent theme. For example, it was emphasized that an improvement in imaging resolution of five- to tenfold may allow scientists and clinicians to see many structures\u2014including endocochlear or endovestibular structures\u2014in sufficient detail, to inform clinical decision-making.\n    Visualizing the inner ear at a resolution necessary for unequivocal diagnoses in the clinician\u2019s office, understanding the mechanisms underlying hearing and balance disorders, and developing and guiding treatments, including gene therapy, will directly support NIDCD\u2019s scientific mission and improve human health.\n    \n \n    Some examples of how advanced inner ear imaging could inform clinical management:\n    \n \n \n     Understanding the underlying molecular basis of inner ear diseases.\n     \n \n     Distinguishing between M\u00e9ni\u00e8re\u2019s disease and\n     vestibular migraines, which can present in similar ways, but require different treatments. In the case of the former, surgical ablation can help, whereas that same procedure could exacerbate vestibular migraines.\n     \n \n     Identifying the correct patient cohort as candidates for future inner ear gene therapies.\n     \n \n     Determining the accuracy and targets of intracochlear treatments including the delivery of gene therapy.\n     \n \n     Measuring the location and realignment of otoconia during canal repositioning treatments, such as the Epley maneuver for treatment of Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV).\n     \n \n     Improving placement of cochlear and vestibular implants.\n     \n \n     Understanding blood vasculature changes and their relation to inner ear diseases.\n     \n \n \n \n     Scope:\n     \n    Applications responsive to this announcement include, but are not limited to, the following general topics:\n    \n \n    1.\n     \n     Development of new non-invasive imaging techniques:\n     \n    Projects may focus on developing new\n     \n     in vivo\n     \n    imaging modalities or novel imaging technologies to provide high-resolution, three-dimensional imaging of inner ear structures.\n    \n \n    2.\n     \n     Improvement of current imaging techniques:\n     \n    Projects may focus on developing new hardware or software tools to improve the spatial resolution, signal-to-noise ratio, or contrast of images from existing imaging techniques, such as micro-CT (computed tomography), OCT (optical computed tomography), super-resolution microscopy, photoacoustic imaging, and\n    MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) including high-strength MRI, and fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging). Projects may also explore new methods for image reconstruction or image processing that can enhance the resolution of existing imaging techniques.\n    \n \n    3.\n     \n     Development of novel imaging probes or contrast agents:\n     \n    Projects may focus on developing new imaging probes or contrast agents that can specifically target and visualize human inner ear structures for high-resolution spatial and functional imaging. Such probes may include, but are not limited to, new nanoparticle-based imaging agents, genetically encoded fluorescent probes, or contrast agents that can selectively bind to human inner ear tissues.\n    \n \n    4.\n     \n     Preparation for translating technology to the clinic\n     \n    : Projects may focus on translating the developed imaging technologies in preparation to be used in a clinical setting. This may include developing new imaging devices that can be used in the clinic, developing new image analysis software, or performing preclinical and clinical studies to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the imaging techniques in animals and humans.\n    \n \n    Some specific targets of opportunities for applications could include, but are not limited to, those listed below:\n    \n \n \n     Differentiating soft tissue from bone in the inner ear\n     \n \n     Visualizing blood vasculature and blood flow in and around the inner ear, and changes to the blood flow patterns\n     \n \n     Imaging the inner ear at cellular and subcellular levels\n     \n \n     Distinguishing air from bone in the human inner ear\n     \n \n     Dynamic movements of inner ear components\n     \n \n     Physiology of inner ear functions\n     \n \n     Detailed images of features such as hair cells, otoliths, membranes, ions\n     \n \n     Determining precise location of calcium carbonate crystals (otoconia)\n     \n \n \n \n     Applications Not Responsive to this\u00a0NOFO\n     \n \n \n    Studies that are not responsive to this funding opportunity and will NOT be reviewed include the following:\n    \n \n \n     Applications that propose imaging modalities or reagents that have no realistic translation potential to image the inner ear of humans\n     \n \n     Studies in non-mammalian species\n     \n \n     Proposed studies not applicable to NIDCD mission areas\n     \n \n     Studies that are considered high-risk clinical trials.

Notice of Funding Opportunity Description\n    \n \n \n \n \n     PURPOSE\n     \n \n \n    The purpose of this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) is to stimulate HIV/AIDS research within the scientific mission areas of the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communications Disorders (NIDCD). Applications should address high priority HIV/AIDS research outlined by the NIH Office of AIDS Research (OAR) [\n     \n     https://www.oar.nih.gov/hiv-policy-and-research/research-priorities\n     \n    ] in the areas of hearing, balance, taste, smell, voice, speech, and language. This NOFO seeks to expand research efforts in communication disorders as they impact people living with HIV (PLWH). Communication disorders not only compromise physical health, but also affect the emotional, social, recreational, educational, and vocational aspects of life. The effects often ripple outward to affect families and social networks, including those at work and school. The impact of these disorders with regards to quality of life and unfulfilled potential is substantial.\n    \n \n \n     OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE\n     \n \n \n    The objective of this NOFO is to advance HIV research addressing NIDCD\u2019s mission areas to inform treatment and prevention strategies to improve the health of PLWH across the lifespan. This NOFO will support hypothesis-driven epidemiological, basic, translational, and clinical research. Multidisciplinary collaborations between investigators in the fields of communication disorders and HIV/AIDS research as well as the leveraging of current HIV/AIDS cohorts and clinical trials are encouraged. Studies on hearing, balance, taste, smell, voice, speech, and/or language that are appropriate for this NOFO include, but are not limited to:\n    \n \n \n     Investigations in children and adults of the impact of acute HIV exposure, chronic HIV infection, and associated co-infections on hearing and communication\n     \n \n     Identification and alleviation of adverse effects on hearing, balance, taste and communication resulting from medications for the treatment of HIV and associated infections in PLWH\n     \n \n     Elucidation of the pathophysiological pathways underlying comorbid communication disorders in PLWH\n     \n \n     Development of prevention or treatment strategies to improve outcomes of comorbid communication disorders in PLWH\n     \n \n \n    For clinical trials, this NOFO will only support low risk clinical trials that meet ALL of the following criteria:\n    \n \n \n     Does not require FDA oversight such as those that involve Investigational New Drug (IND) or Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) approval. For example, clinical trials involving utilization of a licensed product/device for an approved dose, population, and indication may not require an IND or IDE.\n     \n \n     Potential of the intervention to cause physical or psychological harm is low. For example, risks that are no greater than those encountered in routine medical care or procedures.\n     \n \n     Intends to gather scientific data/evidence to inform subsequent studies but not aimed or sufficiently powered to directly change health policy or standard of care and is not an NIH-defined Phase III Clinical Trial (\n      \n      https://grants.nih.gov/policy/clinical-trials/glossary-ct.htm#C\n      \n     ).\n     \n \n \n    Applicants proposing clinical trials that require FDA oversight, exceed this NOFO's budget limits, are intended to formally establish efficacy (NIH-defined Phase III clinical trial) or where the potential risks to cause physical or psychological harm is high are referred to the U01 NOFO\n     \n     PAR-25-318\n     \n    , NIDCD Cooperative Agreement for Clinical Trials in Communication Disorders.\n    \n \n \n     Applications Not Responsive to this NOFO:\n     \n \n \n    Applications that propose to conduct clinical trials that do not meet the above definition of \"low risk\" will be considered non-responsive and will NOT be reviewed.\n    \n \n \n \n    Investigators proposing NIH-defined clinical trials may refer to the\n     \n     Research Methods Resources\n     \n    website for information about developing statistical methods and study designs.\n    \n \n \n \n    See\n     \n     Section VIII.

At the time of submission, applications requesting support for these activities are expected to provide detailed information regarding the study rationale, design, analytic techniques, protocols and procedures, facilities and environment, organizational structure, and collaborative arrangements. This information is best conveyed in a Manual of Procedures (MOP), the development of which represents a costly and time-consuming activity. This clinical research planning grant funding opportunity supports applicants in their planning efforts to conduct collaborative clinical research. The grant may be used to support the development of a MOP, as well as to conduct preliminary studies to refine study procedures or document recruitment potential. The grant must not be used to generate data on the effects of a proposed intervention. This NEI FOA is applicable to both epidemiologic and clinical trial research studies.\n    \n \n \n   Funding Opportunity Goal(s)\n    \n    1) To support eye and vision research projects that address the leading causes of blindness and impaired vision in the U.S. These include retinal diseases; corneal diseases; cataract; glaucoma and optic neuropathies; strabismus; amblyopia; and low vision and blindness rehabilitation. 2) To increase understanding of the normal development and function of the visual system in order to better prevent, diagnose, and treat sight-threatening conditions; and, to enhance the rehabilitation, training, and quality of life of individuals who are partially sighted or blind. 3) To support a broad program of basic vision research through grants and cooperative agreements; to encourage high quality clinical research, including clinical trials, other epidemiological studies, and health services research; to encourage research training and career development in the sciences related to vision; and to sponsor scientific workshops in high priority research areas to encourage exchange of information among scientists.\n    \n This variable defines that we need to start a new row.", "b6345c05-447e-4637-9afa-f88134ecaa47": "PAR-25-358: NEI Clinical Research Study Planning Grant Program (R34 Clinical Trial Not Allowed) Key Dates PAR-25-358: NEI Clinical Research Study Planning Grant Program (R34 Clinical Trial Not Allowed) Key Dates\n    \n \n \n   Posted Date\n   January 10, 2025\n    \n \n   Open Date (Earliest Submission Date)\n   January 16, 2025\n    \n \n   Letter of Intent Due Date(s)\n    \n    Not Applicable\n    \n This variable defines that we need to start a new row.  \n \n \n   The following table includes NIH\n    \n    standard due dates\n    \n   marked with an asterisk.\n    \n \n \n \n       Application Due Dates\n       \n \n       Review and Award Cycles\n       \n \n \n \n       New\n       \n \n       Renewal / Resubmission / Revision (as allowed)\n       \n \n       AIDS - New/Renewal/Resubmission/Revision, as allowed\n       \n \n       Scientific Merit Review\n       \n \n       Advisory Council Review\n       \n \n       Earliest Start Date\n       \n \n \n \n \n \n       February 16, 2025  *\n       \n \n       March 16, 2025 *\n       \n \n       May 07, 2025 *\n       \n \n       July 2025\n       \n \n       October 2025\n       \n \n       December 2025\n       \n \n \n \n       June 16, 2025  *\n       \n \n       July 16, 2025 *\n       \n \n       September 07, 2025 *\n       \n \n       November 2025\n       \n \n       January 2026\n       \n \n       April 2026\n       \n \n \n \n       October 16, 2025  *\n       \n \n       November 16, 2025 *\n       \n \n       January 07, 2026 *\n       \n \n       March 2026\n       \n \n       May 2026\n       \n \n       July 2026\n       \n \n \n \n       February 16, 2026  *\n       \n \n       March 16, 2026 *\n       \n \n       May 07, 2026 *\n       \n \n       July 2026\n       \n \n       October 2026\n       \n \n       December 2026\n       \n \n \n \n       June 16, 2026  *\n       \n \n       July 16, 2026 *\n       \n \n       September 07, 2026 *\n       \n \n       November 2026\n       \n \n       January 2027\n       \n \n       April 2027\n       \n \n \n \n       October 16, 2026  *\n       \n \n       November 16, 2026 *\n       \n \n       January 07, 2027 *\n       \n \n       March 2027\n       \n \n       May 2027\n       \n \n       July 2027\n       \n \n \n \n       February 16, 2027  *\n       \n \n       March 16, 2027 *\n       \n \n       May 07, 2027 *\n       \n \n       July 2027\n       \n \n       October 2027\n       \n \n       December 2027\n       \n \n \n \n       June 16, 2027  *\n       \n \n       July 16, 2027 *\n       \n \n       September 07, 2027 *\n       \n \n       November 2027\n       \n \n       January 2028\n       \n \n       April 2028\n       \n \n \n \n       October 16, 2027  *\n       \n \n       November 16, 2027 *\n       \n \n       January 07, 2028 *\n       \n \n       March 2028\n       \n \n       May 2028\n       \n \n       July 2028\n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    All applications are due by 5:00 PM local time of applicant organization.\n    \n \n    Applicants are encouraged to apply early to allow adequate time to make any corrections to errors found in the application during the submission process by the due date.\n    \n \n \n   Expiration Date\n   January 08, 2028\n    \n \n   Due Dates for E.O. 12372\n    \n    Not Applicable\n    \n This variable defines that we need to start a new row.  \n \n \n   Required Application Instructions\n    \n    It is critical that applicants follow the instructions in the Research (R) Instructions in the\n     \n     How to Apply - Application Guide\n     \n    , except where instructed to do otherwise (in this NOFO or in a Notice from\n     \n     NIH Guide for Grants and Contracts\n     \n    ).\n    \n \n    Conformance to all requirements (both in the Application Guide and the NOFO) is required and strictly enforced.

The planning grant may also support the conduct of preliminary studies to refine study procedures or document recruitment potential (i.e., to demonstrate feasibility). The grant, however, must not be used to generate data on the effects of a proposed intervention, i.e., applicants must not propose any research conducted as part of the planning process that meets the NIH definition of a clinical trial (as defined in\n     \n     NOT-OD-15-015\n     \n    ).\n    \n \n \n     Purpose\n     \n \n \n    The NEI Clinical Research Study Planning Grant is designed to (1) permit early peer review of the rationale for the proposed clinical trial or epidemiologic study, (2) provide support for the development of a complete study protocol and associated documents, including a detailed MOP and statistical analysis plan (SAP), (3) support the development of other essential elements of the clinical study. If a clinical study is ready for implementation and readiness is adequately supported by documentation, submission of an R01, U01 or UG1 application may occur. Note that funding of the Clinical Research Study Planning Grant does not guarantee or imply funding of a subsequent full-scale clinical research study.\n    \n \n \n     Scope\n     \n \n \n    This NOFO supports timely planning activities and development of all materials required for the implementation of a future clinical study.\n    \n \n    Activities supported by this NOFO may include, but are not limited to, the following examples:\n    \n \n \n     Developing and/or finalizing the study protocol and MOP. Basic elements in the protocol and MOP should include identification of the patient population; inclusion and exclusion criteria; adequate plans for recruitment and retention of participants; experimental design and protocols including definition of the study intervention and any comparator groups, if applicable; clear definition of the research hypothesis and outcome measures; quality control/assurance procedures; data management and analytical methods; sample size estimates with justification; administrative procedures, including regulatory approvals if necessary; collaborative arrangements; duties and responsibilities of the study chairperson, clinical sites, coordinating center, and other central resources such as a reading center; monitoring plans to assure patient protection and data integrity; and plans for addressing Federal gender/minority inclusion and human subjects protection requirements. When applicable, the MOP should describe procedures for tracking and monitoring stem cell function and integration in vivo; methods for in-depth stem cell characterization; and plans for sharing data and other resources after the full clinical trial is completed.\n     \n \n     Establishing and documenting collaborative arrangements.\n     \n \n     Conducting administrative procedures necessary for obtaining regulatory authorization or approvals (such as pre-IND/IDE meetings with the FDA and other communications).\n     \n \n     Establishing methods for selecting cGMP compliant stem cell production, phase-appropriate GMP, and/or master cell banks; and for utilization of cGMP standards.Instituting means to assure standardization of procedures across sites and among staff.\n     \n \n     Developing tools needed for data collection and data management.\n     \n \n     Developing and/or finalizing data and safety monitoring plans in the application. Do not name individuals for the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) or Data Monitoring and Oversight Committee (DMOC) but include areas of expertise that will be pertinent in forming these groups.\n     \n \n     Developing plans for any training that is required to carry out the proposed study. This may include, for example, training of data collectors and individuals who will carry out the planned intervention.\n     \n \n \n \n     Standardized Ocular Imaging Expectations:\n     \n \n \n    The NEI encourages applicants to use common formats for files and metadata standards when incorporating ocular imaging in their research proposals (see\n     \n     NOT-EY-24-006\n     \n    ). This applies to both clinical and nonclinical research applications submitted in response to NOFOs where NEI is the issuing or participating organization. It is anticipated the widespread adoption of standardized imaging formats will significantly advance the field by 1) simplifying streamlined digital workflows; 2) enhancing interoperability of large datasets; and 3) developing extensive and comprehensive training sets for artificial intelligence driven research. By promoting these standards, the NEI\u2019s goal is to create an environment where data can be seamlessly integrated and analyzed across different studies, thereby, amplifying the overall impact of vision research.\n    \n \n    To facilitate the exchange of health care information electronically the NEI encourages integration of FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) (\n     \n     https://hl7.org/fhir/us/cdmh/\n     \n    ), OMOP (\n     \n     https://www.ohdsi.org/data-standardization/\n     \n    ) common data model, FAIR (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, Reuse) principles (\n     \n     https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/\n     \n    ) \u00a0for all healthcare data, and DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) standards (\n     \n     https://www.dicomstandard.org/\n     \n    ) for all imaging data.\n    \n \n \n     Milestones\n     \n \n \n    The investigative teams are expected to develop milestones for measuring progress at each point in the clinical research planning process. Milestones should be quantifiable measures that reflect the degree of success of each step.\n    \n \n \n     Applications Not Responsive to this NOFO\n     \n \n \n    The following types of applications will be considered non-responsive to this NOFO and will not be reviewed:\n    \n \n \n     Implementation of a clinical trial (i.e., conducting a research study as part of the planning process that meets the NIH definition of a\n      \n      clinical trial\n      \n     is not permitted on this NOFO)\n     \n \n     Collection of preclinical data (i.e., no preclinical/animal studies are permitted on this NOFO)\n     \n \n \n    Non-responsive applications will not be reviewed.

CDEs are data elements that have been identified and defined for use in multiple data sets across different studies. Use of CDEs can facilitate data sharing and standardization to improve data quality and enable data integration from multiple studies and sources, including electronic health records. NIH ICs have identified CDEs for many clinical domains (e.g., neurological disease), types of studies (e.g. genome-wide association studies (GWAS)), types of outcomes (e.g., patient-reported outcomes), and patient registries (e.g., the Global Rare Diseases Patient Registry and Data Repository). NIH has established a \u201cCommon Data Element (CDE) Resource Portal\" (\n     \n     http://cde.nih.gov/\n     \n    ) to assist investigators in identifying NIH-supported CDEs when developing protocols, case report forms, and other instruments for data collection. The Portal provides guidance about and access to NIH-supported CDE initiatives and other tools and resources for the appropriate use of CDEs and data standards in NIH-funded research. Investigators are encouraged to consult the Portal and describe in their applications any use they will make of NIH-supported CDEs in their projects.\n    \n \n \n   Mandatory Disclosure\n    \n    Recipients or subrecipients must submit any information related to violations of federal criminal law involving fraud, bribery, or gratuity violations potentially affecting the federal award.

Applications submitted to NIH in support of the\n     \n     NIH mission\n     \n    are evaluated for scientific and technical merit through the NIH peer review system.\n    \n \n \n \n    A proposed Clinical Trial application may include study design, methods, and intervention that are not by themselves innovative but address important questions or unmet needs. Additionally, the results of the clinical trial may indicate that further clinical development of the intervention is unwarranted or lead to new avenues of scientific investigation.\n    \n \n \n   Overall Impact - Overall\n    \n    Reviewers will provide an overall impact score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood for the project to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the research field(s) involved, in consideration of the following review criteria and additional review criteria (as applicable for the project proposed).\n    \n \n \n   Scored Review Criteria - Overall\n    \n    Reviewers will consider each of the review criteria below in the determination of scientific merit and give a separate score for each. An application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged likely to have major scientific impact. For example, a project that by its nature is not innovative may be essential to advance a field.\n    \n \n \n \n    Significance\n    \n \n    Does the project address an important problem or a critical barrier to progress in the field? Is the prior research that serves as the key support for the proposed project rigorous? If the aims of the project are achieved, how will scientific knowledge, technical capability, and/or clinical practice be improved?

Notice of Funding Opportunity Description RFA-DK-26-009: New Investigator Gateway Awards for Collaborative T1D Research (R03 Clinical Trial Not Allowed) Section I. Notice of Funding Opportunity Description\n    \n \n \n \n \n     Background\n     \n \n \n    Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease that destroys insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. The loss of proper glucose control that ensues leads to a variety of pathologic consequences, including complications affecting the heart, eye, nerves, kidney and urogenital systems. While the incidence of T1D is increasing worldwide, research continues into the underlying mechanisms contributing to disease onset and severity, and into the development of therapies to effectively prevent or intervene in the disease process.\n    \n \n    The Gateway Award in T1D Research is designed to ensure a robust pipeline of innovative research and talented new investigators in T1D research. In addition to providing support for preliminary research, the Gateway program provides an opportunity for new investigators to pursue their studies within the intellectual environment of a select number of large, ongoing collaborative research programs. Embedding awardees within the established scientific framework afforded by each of these consortia will provide unique opportunities for New Investigators (NI) and Early Stage Investigators (ESI) to increase their understanding of key questions in the field, and for networks to benefit from new ideas and diverse perspectives.\n    \n \n \n \n     Objectives and Scope\n     \n \n \n    The Gateway Award in T1D research supports New Investigators and Early Stage Investigators who are interested in pursuing careers in T1D, including qualified researchers from diverse scientific backgrounds. The goal of the program is to provide support for high quality innovative and significant research by junior faculty engaged in basic, translational and clinical research that will firmly establish the awardees in a T1D-oriented career path and set the stage for competitive first R01 submissions.\n    \n \n    A second key feature of the Gateway program is the opportunity it provides for awardees to enhance their careers through networking with investigators currently engaged in specific T1D-oriented research networks, trials and consortia. Given this feature, research to be supported should address significant barriers in T1D research that fit conceptually within the scope and goals of one of\u00a0the consortia listed below.\n    \n \n \n     The Human Islet Research Network (HIRN):\n     \n    The Human Islet Research Network (HIRN;\n     \n     www.hirnetwork.org\n     \n    ) supports collaborative research into the loss of functional beta cell mass in type 1 diabetes (T1D). HIRN\u2019s overall mission is to better understand how human beta cells are lost in T1D, and to find innovative strategies to protect or replace functional beta cell mass in people with T1D. The HIRN program is configured as a modular network of research consortia, each defined by a specific set of research priorities.\n    \n \n    The four current HIRN consortia include:\n    \n \n    (1) The\n     \n     Consortium on Beta Cell Death and Survival\n     \n    (\n     \n     HIRN-CBDS\n     \n    ) that is using human cells and tissues to discover highly specific biomarkers of beta cell injury in asymptomatic T1D and developing strategies to stop beta cell destruction early in the disease process;\n    \n \n    (2)\n     \n     The Human Pancreas Analysis Consortium\n     \n    (\n     \n     HIRN-HPAC\n     \n    ) that is investigating the physical and functional organization of the human islet tissue environment, the cell-cell relationships within the pancreatic tissue ecosystem, and the contributions of non-endocrine components (acinar, ductal, vascular, perivascular, neuronal, lymphatic, immune) to islet cell function and dysfunction.\n    \n \n    (3)\n     \n     The Consortium on Modeling Autoimmune Diabetes (HIRN-CMAD\n     \n    ) that supports the development of in vitro and in vivo models of type 1 diabetes (T1D) to enable studies of human T1D pathophysiology and to serve as platforms for preclinical assessments of new T1D interventions.\n    \n \n    (4)\n     \n     The Pancreas Knowledgebase Program (HIRN-PanKbase)\n     \n    that is developing a centralized resource of the human pancreas for diabetes research that will provide access to deeply curated high-quality datasets, knowledge in computable forms, and advanced data science tools and workflows; and enable open and reproducible multidisciplinary collaboration toward accelerating biomarker and therapeutic target development.\n    \n \n \n     Research opportunities that could be pursued in collaboration with HIRN consortia include, but are not limited to:\n     \n \n \n \n     Using human islets and pancreatic tissues to identify components of the beta cell and its environment required for maintenance and function and/or instrumental in its pathogenic destruction;\n     \n \n     Identifying therapeutic targets of early disease to prevent the development of a fully developed autoimmune response, or to protect and replenish residual beta cell mass in at-risk or recently-diagnosed individuals;\n     \n \n     Using humanized in vivo models for exploration of the T1D pathogenesis and/or to test potential therapies;\n     \n \n     Developing a biomimetic system that will allow for the exploration of immune?beta cell interactions;\n     \n \n     Developing\n      \n \n \n      i\n      \n     mmune-cell engineering strategies\n      \n \n     to enhance or restore glycemic control.\n     \n \n     Identifying novel biomarkers of T1D or developing synthetic reporter systems to monitor disease initiation, progression and response to therapy; and\n     \n \n     Developing methods for the non-invasive measurement of beta cell mass or function that may be used as endpoints in studies of preventing or ameliorating T1D.\n     \n \n     Studying how human genetics and environmental perturbations interact to contribute to T1D pathogenesis and the heterogeneity of clinical responses to interventions;\n     \n \n     Designing and validating workflows that can be integrated into the PanKbase analytical library, enhancing its capabilities, reproducibility, and usability for researchers.\n     \n \n     Developing use cases for PanKbase resources to map molecular and mechanistic processes underlying T1D etiology, pathology, and prognosis, and to identify composite biomarkers.\n     \n \n     Creating advanced AI models and intelligent agents for information and knowledge extraction. Leveraging prior knowledge to augment and improve the training of AI models on multimodal T1D pancreas datasets.\n      \n \n \n \n \n     Type 1 Diabetes TrialNet:\n     \n    Using knowledge gained through clinical research, TrialNet's mission is to prevent T1D and stop disease progression by preserving insulin production before and after diagnosis (see\n     \n     https://trialnet.org\n     \n    ).\n     \n \n    TrialNet performs multicenter clinical trials of disease-modifying therapies, and longitudinal studies of the natural history of disease and mechanisms of T1D pathogenesis. TrialNet is an international collaborative effort involving clinical investigators, immunologists, islet cell biologists, industry and foundation partners, and families of people with diabetes working together to bring disease-modifying therapies into clinical practice.\n    \n \n \n     Research opportunities that could be pursued in collaboration with TrialNet include, but are not limited to, topics outlined in\n     \n \n \n      https://www.trialnet.org/researchers\n      \n \n \n     such as:\n     \n \n \n \n     Studies of well-characterized biomarkers that have the potential to inform the outcomes of clinical trials, such as surrogate endpoints;\n     \n \n     Defining biomarkers that identify different patient subpopulations based upon mechanism of disease progression, facilitating clinical trial design including therapy selection;\n     \n \n     Research into immune or metabolic pathways that provide insights into pathogenesis and/or therapeutic mechanisms of action;\n     \n \n     Biomarker studies that will validate biomarkers\u00a0against TrialNet clinical endpoints;\n     \n \n     Development of novel assays to measure key features of disease progression or response to therapy; and,\n     \n \n     Research related to the performance of more effective and efficient clinical trials for the prevention of T1D, such as strategies for participant engagement, recruiting, and retention.\n     \n \n \n \n     The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY) Study:\n     \n    The long-term goal of the TEDDY study is to identify infectious agents, dietary factors, or other environmental agents, including psychosocial factors, that trigger T1DM in genetically susceptible individuals or that protect against the disease. Identification of such factors will lead to a better understanding of disease pathogenesis and may result in new strategies to prevent, delay or reverse T1DM. TEDDY currently consists of a consortium of six\n     \n \n      Clinical Centers\n      \n \n    (CC) and a Data Coordinating Center (DCC) that is carrying out studies to identify environmental causes of T1DM in genetically susceptible individuals.\n    \n \n    The TEDDY study investigates: (1) genetic and genetic-environmental interactions, including gestational infection or other gestational events; and (2) childhood infections or other environmental factors after birth, in relation to the development of prediabetic autoimmunity and Type I Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). The CCs recruit and enroll subjects, including obtaining informed consent from parents prior to or shortly after birth, obtain genetic and other samples from neonates and parents, and prospectively follow selected neonates throughout childhood or until development of islet autoimmunity or T1DM. With this approach, the TEDDY Consortium provides a coordinated, multi-disciplinary approach to this complex disease. It is anticipated that collection of information and samples in the standardized manner used by TEDDY may provide greater statistical power in research studies than might be possible in smaller independent investigations. The TEDDY has initiated a nested case-control study that includes samples from children who have developed autoantibodies or have been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, and their age matched controls\u2019 samples, that are analyzed in TEDDY laboratories. Analyses being conducted\u00a0on the samples include assays of\u00a0the gut microbiome, gene expression, proteomics, metabolomics, dietary biomarkers, SNPs, and whole genome sequencing.\u00a0Data from these assays\u00a0are available from the NIDDK Central Repository as well as the TEDDY study website.

Application Review Information RFA-DK-26-009: New Investigator Gateway Awards for Collaborative T1D Research (R03 Clinical Trial Not Allowed) Section V. Application Review Information\n    \n \n \n \n    1. Criteria\n    \n \n    Only the review criteria described below will be considered in the review process. Applications submitted to the NIH in support of the\n     \n     NIH mission\n     \n    are evaluated for scientific and technical merit through the NIH peer review system.\n    \n \n \n \n    For this particular announcement, note the following: The R03 small grant supports discrete, well-defined projects that realistically can be completed in two years and that require limited levels of funding. Because the research project usually is limited, an R03 grant application may not contain extensive detail or discussion. Accordingly, reviewers should evaluate the conceptual framework and general approach to the problem. Appropriate justification for the proposed work can be provided through literature citations, data from other sources, or from investigator-generated data. Preliminary data are not required, particularly in applications proposing pilot or feasibility studies.\n    \n \n \n   Overall Impact\n    \n    Reviewers will provide an overall impact score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood for the project to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the research field(s) involved, in consideration of the following scored review criteria and additional review criteria (as applicable for the project proposed). An application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged likely to have a major scientific impact.\n    \n \n \n   Scored Review Criteria\n    \n    Reviewers will consider Factors 1, 2 and 3 in the determination of scientific merit, and in providing an overall impact score. In addition, Factors 1 and 2 will each receive a separate factor score.\n    \n \n \n \n    Factor 1. Importance of the Research (Significance and Innovation)\n    \n \n \n \n \n \n        Significance\n        \n \n \n \n \n       Evaluate the importance of the proposed research in the context of current scientific challenges and opportunities, either for advancing knowledge within the field, or more broadly. Assess whether the application addresses an important gap in knowledge in the field, would solve a critical problem, or create a valuable conceptual or technical advance.\n       \n \n       Evaluate the rationale for undertaking the study, the rigor of the scientific background for the work (e.g., prior literature and/or preliminary data) and whether the scientific background justifies the proposed study.\n       \n \n \n \n \n        Innovation\n        \n \n \n \n \n       Evaluate the extent to which innovation influences the importance of undertaking the proposed research. Note that while technical or conceptual innovation can influence the importance of the proposed research, a project that is not applying novel concepts or approaches may be of critical importance for the field.\n       \n \n       Evaluate whether the proposed work applies novel concepts, methods or technologies\u00a0or uses existing concepts, methods, technologies\u00a0in novel ways, to enhance\u00a0the overall impact of the project.\n       \n \n \n \n \n \n    Factor 2. Rigor and Feasibility (Approach)\n    \n \n \n \n \n \n        Approach\n        \n \n \n \n \n       Evaluate the scientific quality of the proposed work. Evaluate the likelihood that compelling, reproducible findings will result (rigor) and assess whether the proposed studies can be done well and within the timeframes proposed (feasibility).\n       \n \n \n \n \n        Rigor:\n        \n \n \n \n \n       Evaluate the potential to produce unbiased, reproducible, robust data.\n       \n \n       Evaluate the rigor of experimental design and whether appropriate controls are in place.\n       \n \n       Evaluate whether the sample size is sufficient and well-justified.\n       \n \n       Assess the quality of the plans for analysis, interpretation, and reporting of results.\n       \n \n       Evaluate whether the investigators presented adequate plans to address relevant biological variables, such as sex or age, in the design, analysis, and reporting.\n       \n \n       For applications involving human subjects or vertebrate animals, also evaluate:\n        \n \n         the rigor of the intervention or study manipulation (if applicable to the study design).\n         \n \n         whether outcome variables are justified.\n         \n \n         whether the results will be generalizable or, in the case of a rare disease/special group, relevant to the particular subgroup.\n         \n \n         whether the sample is appropriate and sufficiently diverse to address the proposed question(s).\n         \n \n \n \n       For applications involving human subjects, including clinical trials, assess the adequacy of inclusion plans as appropriate for the scientific goals of the research. Considerations of appropriateness may include disease/condition/behavior incidence, prevalence, or population burden, population representation, and/or current state of the science.\n       \n \n \n \n \n        Feasibility:\n        \n \n \n \n \n       Evaluate whether the proposed approach is sound and achievable, including plans to address problems or new challenges that emerge in the work. For proposed studies in which feasibility may be less certain, evaluate whether the uncertainty is balanced by the potential for major advances.\n       \n \n       For applications involving human subjects, including clinical trials, evaluate the adequacy and feasibility of the plan to recruit and retain an appropriately diverse population of participants. Additionally, evaluate the likelihood of successfully achieving the proposed enrollment based on age, racial, ethnic, and sex or gender categories.\n       \n \n       For clinical trial applications, evaluate whether the study timeline and milestones are feasible.\n       \n \n \n \n \n \n    Factor 3. Expertise and Resources (Investigator(s) and Environment)\n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        Investigator(s)\n        \n \n \n \n      Evaluate whether the investigator(s) have demonstrated background, training, and expertise, as appropriate for their career stage, to conduct the proposed work. For Multiple Principal Investigator (MPI) applications, assess the quality of the leadership plan to facilitate coordination and collaboration.\n      \n \n \n \n        Environment\n        \n \n \n \n      Evaluate whether the institutional resources are appropriate to ensure the successful execution of the proposed work.\n      \n \n \n \n \n \n   Additional Review Criteria\n    \n    As applicable for the project proposed, reviewers will consider the following additional items while determining scientific and technical merit, but will not give criterion scores for these items, and should consider them in providing an overall impact score.\n    \n \n \n \n    Protections for Human Subjects\n    \n \n \n \n      For research that involves human subjects but does not involve one of the categories of research that are exempt under 45 CFR Part 46, evaluate the justification for involvement of human subjects and the proposed protections from research risk relating to their participation according to the following five review criteria: 1) risk to subjects; 2) adequacy of protection against risks; 3) potential benefits to the subjects and others; 4) importance of the knowledge to be gained; and 5) data and safety monitoring for clinical trials.\n      \n \n      For research that involves human subjects and meets the criteria for one or more of the categories of research that are exempt under 45 CFR Part 46, evaluate: 1) the justification for the exemption; 2) human subjects involvement and characteristics; and 3) sources of materials.
